#+DESCRIPTION: Living model of user intent, preference, and configuration semantics

* Purpose

This directory contains the *perpetual specification* — a continuously
refined, never-complete model of the user's intents, preferences, and
declared configuration semantics across all domains.

Unlike docs/ (project documentation, ADRs) or docs/specs/ (implementation
specs with lifecycles), perpetual/ has no end state. Every file here
represents the current truth, subject to revision through *preference
elicitation* — the formal protocol by which the agent surfaces options,
presents recommendations, and records the user's declared preference.

* Taxonomy

Each file covers one domain. Domains are discovered through use — when
the agent encounters a decision that depends on user preference and no
prior elicitation exists, a new domain file is created.

| Domain | File | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Input Emulation | [[file:input-emulation.org][input-emulation.org]] | Active |
| Audio Feedback | [[file:audio-feedback.org][audio-feedback.org]] | Pending |
| Workspace Layout | [[file:workspace-layout.org][workspace-layout.org]] | Pending |

* Preference Entry Structure

Each preference within a domain file follows this structure:

#+begin_example
** Preference: <short name>
:PROPERTIES:
:STATUS: provisional | settled | deprecated
:ELICITED: <date>
:SOURCE: <conversation reference or session ID>
:END:

*** Context
Why this preference matters.

*** Options Considered
1. Option A — tradeoffs
2. Option B — tradeoffs

*** Decision
What was chosen and why.

*** Calculus
The concrete lookup table, decision rule, or dispatch logic
that this preference produces.
#+end_example

* Elicitation Protocol

When the agent identifies a domain requiring user preference:

1. *Identify* — Name the domain and the specific decision
2. *Enumerate* — List options with tradeoffs (no more than 4)
3. *Recommend* — State an opinionated recommendation with rationale
4. *Record* — On user decision, write the preference entry
5. *Generate* — Produce the decision calculus (lookup table, dispatch rule)
6. *Index* — vault-rag indexes the file for semantic search

The user's common pattern of asking "what are my options and what's your
recommendation?" is the natural language form of this protocol.
