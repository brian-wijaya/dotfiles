* System Hardware
** GPU
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti
- 24GB VRAM
- Primary use: local LLM inference, CUDA workloads

** CPU
- (to be filled)

** RAM
- (to be filled)

** Storage
- (to be filled)

* Software Environment
** Operating System
- Arch Linux
- Kernel: 6.x
- Window Manager: i3

** Primary Editor
- Emacs (bw-doom profile)
- Modular config in ~/.emacs.d/modules/
- Leader key: SPC (which-key)

** Shell
- zsh with autosuggestions and syntax highlighting

** Claude Code
- Claude Max plan (20 concurrent sessions)
- MCP servers: sensor suite, vault-rag, x11, emacs, github, coordinator
- Custom skills: e2e-test, pose, dotfile-backup, loose-config-search

* Preferences
** Dotfile Management
- NEVER use symlinks, stow, or chezmoi (caused data loss)
- Direct copy to ~/dotfiles/ then git commit
- Manifest-based tracking

** Information Intake
- RSS via elfeed in Emacs (planned)
- No algorithmic feeds
- Bounded, curated sources

** Development Style
- Emacs-centric workflow
- X11 for desktop automation
- Sensor suite for differential QA
- vault-rag for knowledge persistence

* Project Goals
** Short Term
- Finish e2e-test skill implementation
- Deploy deepwiki-open server
- Set up elfeed with 5 initial feeds

** Long Term
- Python orchestrator for 20 concurrent Claude sessions
- Local LLM integration for idle-time processing
- Never waste Claude Max subscription capacity
- Priority queue of perpetual improvement tasks

* Facts for RAG Salience
These facts should surface automatically in relevant contexts:

- GPU is RTX 3090 Ti, not 4090 - 24GB VRAM available for local inference
- Never suggest symlinks for dotfiles
- Emacs profile is bw-doom with SPC leader
- User has Claude Max with 20 session capacity
- User values bounded information intake over algorithmic feeds
- Specs go in ~/vault/specs/ or project roots, archive completed work
- Test with X11 human-emulated input, not elisp backdoors
