    as: "user replacing direct social media"
    i_want: "a visually rich, engaging feed where every item was vetted by my LLM agents"
    so_that: "I get the experience I enjoy without someone else deciding what I see"
    acceptance:
      - feed is visually rich — thumbnails, video previews, rich media for vetted content
      - LLM agents act as bouncers, not censors — they filter, they don't strip
      - no platform engagement metrics shown (likes, retweets, upvotes, view counts)
      - every item has a confidence indicator and direct link to original source
      - every item is explicitly marked as AI-vetted
      - user can punch through to raw source content at any time
      - feed can be as healthy or unhealthy as the user configures — no moral guardrails

  - id: US-011
    as: "user configuring my feed"
    i_want: "to choose my models, sources, search terms, triggers, and layout"
    so_that: "every axis of the system reflects my preferences"
    acceptance:
      - model selection: user picks from approved open-source models (owner curates list)
      - source selection: tick-box per platform/publication/forum
      - free sources checked by default in main feed
      - paid sources visible but unticked by default (discovery/upsell)
      - search terms: user-defined queries that drive the crawler
      - news triggers (tripwires): user-defined event conditions
      - negative weights: user can penalize hype, emotional language, vague claims
      - all configuration is inspectable, versioned, exportable, importable
      - Emacs client exposes config as editable structured data

  - id: US-012
    as: "user browsing the main feed"
    i_want: "a smart interleaved mix of content blocks ranked by my algorithm"
    so_that: "I get the default experience that's tasteful and useful out of the box"
    acceptance:
      - main feed is the default — interleaved across all checked sources and modalities
      - ranking function is visible and editable
      - each item shows: why it appeared, which criteria it scored on
      - vertical or horizontal autoscroll toggle
      - vertical/horizontal carousels by category (optional layout)
      - no hard time limits, no usage shaming, no "take a break" prompts

  - id: US-013
    as: "user who wants a filtered view"
    i_want: "custom feeds filtered by modality or source"
    so_that: "I can browse just videos, just tweets, just articles when I want to"
    acceptance:
      - custom feed creation: filter by modality (video, audio, text, articles)
      - custom feed creation: filter by source (YouTube only, Reddit only, etc.)
      - custom feeds are saved, named, and accessible alongside main feed
      - custom feeds use the same ranking function as main feed (filtered subset)
      - main feed remains the default; custom feeds are opt-in views

  - id: US-014
    as: "user who wants to listen"
    i_want: "autoplay to narrate/play items in ranked order"
    so_that: "I absorb information passively like a personalized news channel"
    acceptance:
      - audio feed mode: TTS narration of text summaries + original audio/video content
      - items play in ranked order, skippable
      - modality interleaving configurable
      - background playback on mobile
      - queue position synced across devices (premium)

  - id: US-015
    as: "user who hates a source"
    i_want: "to rage-quit a source out of my feed with escalating intensity"
    so_that: "I feel cathartic satisfaction and emotional investment in my feed"
    acceptance:
      - thumbs-down once: reduces source weight
      - thumbs-down rapid tap: weight reduction compounds with speed
      - within 2000ms of aggressive tapping: "obliterate" — source permanently removed
      - obliterate is visually satisfying (animation, feedback, finality)
      - obliterated sources can be restored from settings (not permanently lost)
      - thumbs-down signal feeds back into ranking algorithm for related content
      - "rage-quitting" is a designed, intentional feature — not an accident

  - id: US-016
    as: "user managing compute budget"
    i_want: "a single visual bar showing how my choices consume compute resources"
    so_that: "I understand tradeoffs and feel in control of my experience"
    acceptance:
      - single horizontal bar with colored segments per pipeline stage
      - segments: crawling, transcription, summarization, ranking, storage
      - bar fills as user ticks options (more sources, better models, more hours)
      - percentages shown per segment
      - swapping models immediately updates the bar (real-time feedback)
      - reducing scheduled hours compresses the bar (fewer hours = each hour more loaded)
      - bar exceeding 100% is an honest warning, not a hard block
      - "Learn More" links contextually placed throughout budget UI

  - id: US-017
    as: "user configuring feed refresh"
    i_want: "to choose when and how my feed updates"
    so_that: "I control the rhythm of new content arriving"
    acceptance:
      - manual refresh (pull to refresh / button)
      - persistently current (live stream, constantly loading new items)
      - automatic on app reopen
      - automatic on app startup
      - configurable per-feed (main feed vs custom feeds can have different refresh modes)

  - id: US-018
    as: "user who spotted something important"
    i_want: "to punch through to the original source"
    so_that: "I can verify, engage, or go deeper"
    acceptance:
      - one-tap access to original URL
      - opens in external browser, not in-app webview
      - Actual Feed does not track which originals the user visits
      - return to feed resumes at same position

collective_lifetime_stories:

    title: "LLM hallucination and misrepresentation over millions of items"
    description: >
      At scale, the LLM will misrepresent source content. A 2% hallucination rate
      across 500 items/day means 10 misrepresented items daily. Over months, this
      erodes trust unless the system makes verification effortless. The confidence
      indicator and one-tap source access are the mechanism that keeps the vetting
      layer from becoming a distortion layer.
    worst_case: >
      User makes a professional decision based on an LLM-hallucinated summary
      without checking the source. System must make verification psychologically
      easy — source link prominent, not buried.

  - id: CL-011
    title: "User dependency and single point of failure"
    description: >
      If Actual Feed succeeds, users stop visiting platforms directly. If the
      crawler breaks or a source goes dark, the user has no fallback habit.
      System must be reliable enough to be the sole information interface, or
      honest enough to say when it can't be.
    worst_case: >
      Major platform blocks automated access. User's feed goes partially dark.
      System surfaces: "YouTube crawling is down. Direct link to resume manual
      browsing." Never silently drops a source.

  - id: CL-012
    title: "Platform content format drift"
    description: >
      Platforms change their content structure regularly. Each change can break
      the content extraction pipeline. System needs modular extractor-per-source
      architecture where adapters update independently of core.
    worst_case: >
      Three platforms change format in the same month. 60% of feed breaks.
      Adapter update cadence must exceed platform change cadence.

  - id: CL-013
    title: "Compute budget perception vs reality over hardware generations"
    description: >
      The compute budget bar shows relative resource consumption. As hardware
      improves, the same configuration costs less. As models improve, better
      quality costs the same. The bar must reflect actual device capabilities,
      not fixed benchmarks — it must be dynamically calibrated to the user's
      hardware. A 2026 phone and a 2029 phone running the same config should
      show different bar levels.
    worst_case: >
      User upgrades phone, bar doesn't change, user feels cheated. Or: user
      downgrades device, bar overflows, existing config can't run. Must handle
      both directions gracefully.

    title: "Obliterate feature abuse and preference lock-in"
    description: >
      The rage-quit obliterate is emotionally satisfying but creates irreversible
      filter bubbles if overused. A user who obliterates 50 sources in their first
      week may have an impoverished feed by month two. The system must make
      restoration easy and periodically surface: "You've obliterated N sources.
      Review?" without being preachy.
    worst_case: >
      User obliterates a source, forgets, later wonders why they never see content
      from that domain. Must be discoverable in settings, not hidden.

enforced_constraints:
  - id: EC-010
    constraint: "Every item must link to its original source"
    type: trust
    rationale: "Vetting layer must never become a distortion layer"
    testable: "No FeedItem renders without a valid source_url"

  - id: EC-011
    constraint: "No platform engagement metrics displayed"
    type: design
    rationale: "Likes, upvotes, view counts are engagement manipulation. Stripped."
    testable: "FeedItem schema has no fields for platform engagement metrics"

  - id: EC-012
    constraint: "Obliterate is reversible from settings"
    type: safety
    rationale: "Rage decisions in 2000ms must be undoable in calm moments"
    testable: "Settings > Obliterated Sources shows full list with restore option"

  - id: EC-013
    constraint: "Compute budget bar reflects actual device capabilities"
    type: honesty
    rationale: "Static benchmarks lie as hardware changes. Bar must be dynamic."
    testable: "Bar recalibrates on app startup based on detected RAM, CPU, storage"

opinionated_constraints:
  - id: OC-010
    constraint: "LLM agents are bouncers, not censors — they vet, not strip"
    rationale: >
      The feed is visually rich. Thumbnails, video previews, rich media are shown
      for vetted content. The LLM decides what enters the feed, but does not
      degrade the visual experience of what it admits. This product competes
      with social media on appeal, not austerity.
    acceptable_loss: >
      LLM processing adds latency. A tweet posted 30 seconds ago may take
      2-5 minutes to appear after crawl + vetting. Acceptable for target user.

  - id: OC-011
    constraint: "Main feed is the default — interleaved, tasteful, smart mix"
    rationale: >
      The main feed is the product's first impression. It must feel curated
      and alive out of the box. Custom filtered feeds exist for power users
      but the main feed is what sells the product. Default includes all free
      sources checked, paid sources visible but unticked.
    acceptable_loss: >
      Users who only want one source type must create a custom feed. The main
      feed cannot be reduced to a single-source view.

  - id: OC-012
    constraint: "User chooses their own open-source models from a curated list"
    rationale: >
      Power users want control. Model choice affects quality and resource usage.
      Curation prevents support burden. Compute budget bar makes tradeoffs visible.
    acceptable_loss: >
      Users may choose inferior models. Mitigation: recommended defaults,
      clear documentation, budget bar shows quality vs resource tradeoff.

  - id: OC-013
    constraint: "The product makes you feel more intelligent, healthy, and deliberate"
    rationale: >
      This is the emotional promise. Not "we protect you from bad content" (preachy)
      but "we give you the tools to be intentional" (empowering). Learn More plugs
      throughout. Compute budget visualization. Rage-quit obliterate. Every feature
      reinforces user agency and competence.
    acceptable_loss: >
      Some users will configure an unhealthy feed. That is their right. The system
      does not moralize. "As healthy or unhealthy as you like."
