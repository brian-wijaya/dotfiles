user_stories:
  - id: US-010
    as: "user replacing direct social media"
    i_want: "a visually rich, engaging feed where every item was vetted by my LLM agents"
    so_that: "I get the experience I enjoy without someone else deciding what I see"
    acceptance:
      - feed is visually rich — thumbnails, video previews, rich media for vetted content
      - LLM agents act as bouncers, not censors — they filter, they don't strip
      - no platform engagement metrics shown (likes, retweets, upvotes, view counts)
      - every item has a confidence indicator and direct link to original source
      - every item is explicitly marked as AI-vetted
      - user can punch through to raw source content at any time
      - feed can be as healthy or unhealthy as the user configures — no moral guardrails

  - id: US-011
    as: "user configuring my feed"
    i_want: "to choose my models, sources, search terms, triggers, and layout"
    so_that: "every axis of the system reflects my preferences"
    acceptance:
      - "model selection: user picks from approved open-source models (owner curates list)"
      - "source selection: tick-box per platform/publication/forum"
      - free sources checked by default in main feed
      - paid sources visible but unticked by default (discovery/upsell)
      - "search terms: user-defined queries that drive the crawler"
      - "news triggers (tripwires): user-defined event conditions"
      - "negative weights: user can penalize hype, emotional language, vague claims"
      - all configuration is inspectable, versioned, exportable, importable
      - Emacs client exposes config as editable structured data

  - id: US-012
    as: "user browsing the main feed"
    i_want: "a smart interleaved mix of content blocks ranked by my algorithm"
    so_that: "I get the default experience that's tasteful and useful out of the box"
    acceptance:
      - main feed is the default — interleaved across all checked sources and modalities
      - ranking function is visible and editable
      - "each item shows: why it appeared, which criteria it scored on"
      - vertical or horizontal autoscroll toggle
      - vertical/horizontal carousels by category (optional layout)
      - no hard time limits, no usage shaming, no "take a break" prompts

  - id: US-013
    as: "user who wants a filtered view"
    i_want: "custom feeds filtered by modality or source"
    so_that: "I can browse just videos, just tweets, just articles when I want to"
    acceptance:
      - "custom feed creation: filter by modality (video, audio, text, articles)"
      - "custom feed creation: filter by source (YouTube only, Reddit only, etc.)"
      - custom feeds are saved, named, and accessible alongside main feed
      - custom feeds use the same ranking function as main feed (filtered subset)
      - main feed remains the default; custom feeds are opt-in views

  - id: US-014
    as: "user who wants to listen"
    i_want: "autoplay to narrate/play items in ranked order"
    so_that: "I absorb information passively like a personalized news channel"
    acceptance:
      - "audio feed mode: TTS narration of text summaries + original audio/video content"
      - items play in ranked order, skippable
      - modality interleaving configurable
      - background playback on mobile
      - queue position synced across devices (premium)

  - id: US-015
    as: "user who hates a source"
    i_want: "to rage-quit a source out of my feed with escalating intensity"
    so_that: "I feel cathartic satisfaction and emotional investment in my feed"
    acceptance:
      - "thumbs-down once: reduces source weight"
      - "thumbs-down rapid tap: weight reduction compounds with speed"
      - "within 2000ms of aggressive tapping: \"obliterate\" — source permanently removed"
      - obliterate is visually satisfying (animation, feedback, finality)
      - obliterated sources can be restored from settings (not permanently lost)
      - thumbs-down signal feeds back into ranking algorithm for related content
      - "\"rage-quitting\" is a designed, intentional feature — not an accident"

  - id: US-015b
    as: "user who loves a source"
    i_want: "to exalt a source with escalating intensity, the opposite of obliterate"
    so_that: "my best sources get maximum algorithmic boost and I never miss their content"
    acceptance:
      - "thumbs-up once: increases source weight"
      - "thumbs-up rapid tap: weight increase compounds with speed"
      - "within 2000ms of aggressive tapping: 'exalt' — source permanently boosted to maximum"
      - exalt is visually satisfying (golden glow animation, ascending feedback, triumph)
      - "exalted source effects: source_authority locked to 1.0 (maximum positive weight)"
      - "exalted source effects: items from exalted sources get a distinctive badge in the feed (star/crown)"
      - exalted sources listed in settings with restore (un-exalt) option
      - exalt signal feeds back into neural taste model as strong positive
      - "symmetry with obliterate: obliterate = permanent negative terminal, exalt = permanent positive terminal"
      - "exalt does NOT trigger notifications — that's what tripwires are for (separate concerns)"
      - "exalt does NOT exempt from budget enforcement — budgets are budgets"
      - no cap on exalted sources — same philosophy as obliterate (no moral guardrails on user choices)

  - id: US-015c
    as: "user who wants granular feedback on a specific item"
    i_want: "a 'Tune My Recommendations' menu on each content card"
    so_that: "I can tell the algorithm exactly why I liked or disliked something"
    acceptance:
      - kebab menu (three dots) on bottom-right corner of every content card
      - "menu options include:"
      - "  'More like this' — positive signal on item's topics, source, modality, and feature profile"
      - "  'Less like this' — negative signal on item's topics, source, modality, and feature profile"
      - "  'Already seen / done with' — marks as consumed, suppresses repetition, NOT a negative signal"
      - "  'Often revisit' — marks as evergreen, exempts from freshness decay penalty"
      - "  'Not relevant anymore' — time-bounded negative on this topic cluster (suppress for 7 days, configurable)"
      - "  'Misleading / spam' — strong negative on source credibility, feeds into source_authority decay"
      - "  'Why was this recommended?' — opens score breakdown (same as existing, but more discoverable)"
      - all menu actions logged to user_interactions with interaction_type and context_json
      - menu actions feed into both formula adjustments and neural taste model training
      - "'Already seen' and 'Often revisit' are NOT negative — they are consumption metadata"
      - "'Not relevant anymore' has a configurable suppression window (default 7 days, adjustable in settings)"
      - menu is identical across desktop, mobile, and Emacs (Emacs uses transient menu)

  - id: US-016
    as: "user managing compute budget"
    i_want: "a single visual bar showing how my choices consume compute resources"
    so_that: "I understand tradeoffs and feel in control of my experience"
    acceptance:
      - single horizontal bar with colored segments per pipeline stage
      - "segments: crawling, transcription, summarization, ranking, storage"
      - bar fills as user ticks options (more sources, better models, more hours)
      - percentages shown per segment
      - swapping models immediately updates the bar (real-time feedback)
      - reducing scheduled hours compresses the bar (fewer hours = each hour more loaded)
      - bar exceeding 100% is an honest warning, not a hard block
      - "\"Learn More\" links contextually placed throughout budget UI"

  - id: US-017
    as: "user configuring feed refresh"
    i_want: "to choose when and how my feed updates"
    so_that: "I control the rhythm of new content arriving"
    acceptance:
      - manual refresh (pull to refresh / button)
      - persistently current (live stream, constantly loading new items)
      - automatic on app reopen
      - automatic on app startup
      - configurable per-feed (main feed vs custom feeds can have different refresh modes)

  - id: US-018
    as: "user who spotted something important"
    i_want: "to punch through to the original source"
    so_that: "I can verify, engage, or go deeper"
    acceptance:
      - one-tap access to original URL
      - opens in external browser, not in-app webview
      - Actual Feed does not track which originals the user visits
      - return to feed resumes at same position

collective_lifetime_stories:
  - id: CL-010
    title: "LLM hallucination and misrepresentation over millions of items"
    description: >
      At scale, the LLM will misrepresent source content. A 2% hallucination rate
      across 500 items/day means 10 misrepresented items daily. Over months, this
      erodes trust unless the system makes verification effortless. The confidence
      indicator and one-tap source access are the mechanism that keeps the vetting
      layer from becoming a distortion layer.
    worst_case: >
      User makes a professional decision based on an LLM-hallucinated summary
      without checking the source. System must make verification psychologically
      easy — source link prominent, not buried.

  - id: CL-011
    title: "User dependency and single point of failure"
    description: >
      If Actual Feed succeeds, users stop visiting platforms directly. If the
      crawler breaks or a source goes dark, the user has no fallback habit.
      System must be reliable enough to be the sole information interface, or
      honest enough to say when it can't be.
    worst_case: >
      Major platform blocks automated access. User's feed goes partially dark.
      System surfaces: "YouTube crawling is down. Direct link to resume manual
      browsing." Never silently drops a source.

  - id: CL-012
    title: "Platform content format drift"
    description: >
      Platforms change their content structure regularly. Each change can break
      the content extraction pipeline. System needs modular extractor-per-source
      architecture where adapters update independently of core.
    worst_case: >
      Three platforms change format in the same month. 60% of feed breaks.
      Adapter update cadence must exceed platform change cadence.

  - id: CL-013
    title: "Compute budget perception vs reality over hardware generations"
    description: >
      The compute budget bar shows relative resource consumption. As hardware
      improves, the same configuration costs less. As models improve, better
      quality costs the same. The bar must reflect actual device capabilities,
      not fixed benchmarks — it must be dynamically calibrated to the user's
      hardware. A 2026 phone and a 2029 phone running the same config should
      show different bar levels.
    worst_case: >
      User upgrades phone, bar doesn't change, user feels cheated. Or: user
      downgrades device, bar overflows, existing config can't run. Must handle
      both directions gracefully.

  - id: CL-014
    title: "Obliterate feature abuse and preference lock-in"
    description: >
      The rage-quit obliterate is emotionally satisfying but creates irreversible
      filter bubbles if overused. A user who obliterates 50 sources in their first
      week may have an impoverished feed by month two. The system must make
      restoration easy and periodically surface: "You've obliterated N sources.
      Review?" without being preachy.
    worst_case: >
      User obliterates a source, forgets, later wonders why they never see content
      from that domain. Must be discoverable in settings, not hidden.

  - id: CL-015
    title: "Exalt overuse and quality drift"
    description: >
      Exalt is the positive terminal — source_authority locked to 1.0,
      purely for influencing the feed algorithm. No cap on exalted sources.
      But exalted sources that go silent for months or pivot to low-quality
      content should surface a review prompt. Exalt is devotion, not
      permanent entitlement — sources change quality over time.
    worst_case: >
      User exalts a source that later pivots to low-quality content. The
      source_authority lock means bad content is permanently boosted.
      Mitigation: weekly digest of exalted source performance (items
      produced, user engagement with those items). If engagement drops
      below threshold for 30 days, prompt to review.

    title: "Tune My Recommendations signal quality and gaming"
    description: >
      The kebab menu feedback options produce granular signals. But users may
      use them inconsistently — clicking 'More like this' on everything, or
      using 'Misleading/spam' as a soft dislike. The neural taste model must
      weight these signals appropriately. 'Misleading/spam' must have stronger
      effect than 'Less like this' but not be abusable as a super-downvote.
    worst_case: >
      User marks everything from a political source as 'Misleading/spam'
      because they disagree. The source_authority decay is disproportionate.
      Mitigation: 'Misleading/spam' requires a minimum threshold of reports
      (3+ items from same source) before triggering source_authority decay.
      Single-item reports are treated as strong 'Less like this' only.

  - id: EC-011
    constraint: "No platform engagement metrics displayed"
    type: design
    rationale: "Likes, upvotes, view counts are engagement manipulation. Stripped."
    testable: "FeedItem schema has no fields for platform engagement metrics"

  - id: EC-012
    constraint: "Obliterate is reversible from settings"
    type: safety
    rationale: "Rage decisions in 2000ms must be undoable in calm moments"
    testable: "Settings > Obliterated Sources shows full list with restore option"

  - id: EC-014
    constraint: "Exalt is reversible from settings"
    type: safety
    rationale: >
      Devotion decisions in 2000ms must be undoable in calm moments. No cap —
      same philosophy as obliterate. If the user exalts 200 sources and drowns
      in notifications, they un-exalt. We don't moralize.
    testable: "Settings > Exalted Sources shows full list with un-exalt option."

  - id: EC-015
    constraint: "All kebab menu feedback actions are logged to user_interactions with full context"
    type: data integrity
    rationale: >
      Every feedback action (more_like_this, less_like_this, already_seen,
      often_revisit, not_relevant_anymore, misleading_spam) must be append-only
      logged with item_id, interaction_type, and context_json containing the
      item's current feature vector snapshot. This is training data.
    testable: "After each kebab menu action, user_interactions contains a new row with correct type and context."

  - id: EC-013
    constraint: "Compute budget bar reflects actual device capabilities"
    type: honesty
    rationale: "Static benchmarks lie as hardware changes. Bar must be dynamic."
    testable: "Bar recalibrates on app startup based on detected RAM, CPU, storage"

opinionated_constraints:
  - id: OC-010
    constraint: "LLM agents are bouncers, not censors — they vet, not strip"
    rationale: >
      The feed is visually rich. Thumbnails, video previews, rich media are shown
      for vetted content. The LLM decides what enters the feed, but does not
      degrade the visual experience of what it admits. This product competes
      with social media on appeal, not austerity.
    acceptable_loss: >
      LLM processing adds latency. A tweet posted 30 seconds ago may take
      2-5 minutes to appear after crawl + vetting. Acceptable for target user.

  - id: OC-011
    constraint: "Main feed is the default — interleaved, tasteful, smart mix"
    rationale: >
      The main feed is the product's first impression. It must feel curated
      and alive out of the box. Custom filtered feeds exist for power users
      but the main feed is what sells the product. Default includes all free
      sources checked, paid sources visible but unticked.
    acceptable_loss: >
      Users who only want one source type must create a custom feed. The main
      feed cannot be reduced to a single-source view.

  - id: OC-012
    constraint: "User chooses their own open-source models from a curated list"
    rationale: >
      Power users want control. Model choice affects quality and resource usage.
      Curation prevents support burden. Compute budget bar makes tradeoffs visible.
    acceptable_loss: >
      Users may choose inferior models. Mitigation: recommended defaults,
      clear documentation, budget bar shows quality vs resource tradeoff.

  - id: OC-013
    constraint: "The product makes you feel more intelligent, healthy, and deliberate"
    rationale: >
      This is the emotional promise. Not "we protect you from bad content" (preachy)
      but "we give you the tools to be intentional" (empowering). Learn More plugs
      throughout. Compute budget visualization. Rage-quit obliterate. Every feature
      reinforces user agency and competence.
    acceptable_loss: >
      Some users will configure an unhealthy feed. That is their right. The system
      does not moralize. "As healthy or unhealthy as you like."

  - id: OC-014
    constraint: "Exalt and obliterate are symmetrical terminal gestures — same mechanic, opposite polarity"
    rationale: >
      The interaction model has a spectrum from passive (scroll past) to active
      (thumbs up/down) to terminal (exalt/obliterate). Terminal gestures are
      emotionally loaded, visually distinctive, and algorithmically decisive.
      This symmetry is a design commitment — the user has equal power to
      permanently promote and permanently demote.
    acceptable_loss: >
      Two terminal gestures is more complex than one. Users who never exalt
      still get a good feed. Exalt is a power-user feature that rewards
      intentional curation.

  - id: OC-015
    constraint: "Kebab menu 'Tune My Recommendations' is the granular feedback channel — not the primary one"
    rationale: >
      Thumbs up/down and exalt/obliterate are the primary interaction signals.
      The kebab menu is for users who want to explain WHY. It produces richer
      signals but requires more intent. The feed must work well with zero
      kebab menu usage. The menu is a power-user refinement layer, not
      a required interaction.
    acceptable_loss: >
      Most users will never open the kebab menu. The signals from thumbs
      up/down are sufficient for neural taste model training. Kebab menu
      signals accelerate convergence but are not required for it.
