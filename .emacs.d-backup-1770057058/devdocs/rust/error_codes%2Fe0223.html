<h1 id="error-code-e0223">Error code E0223</h1> <p>An attempt was made to retrieve an associated type, but the type was ambiguous.</p> <p>Erroneous code example:</p> <pre data-language="rust">trait Trait { type X; }

fn main() {
    let foo: Trait::X;
}</pre> <p>The problem here is that we're attempting to take the associated type of <code>X</code> from <code>Trait</code>. Unfortunately, the type of <code>X</code> is not defined, because it's only made concrete in implementations of the trait. A working version of this code might look like:</p> <pre data-language="rust">trait Trait { type X; }

struct Struct;
impl Trait for Struct {
    type X = u32;
}

fn main() {
    let foo: &lt;Struct as Trait&gt;::X;
}</pre> <p>This syntax specifies that we want the associated type <code>X</code> from <code>Struct</code>'s implementation of <code>Trait</code>.</p> <p>Due to internal limitations of the current compiler implementation we cannot simply use <code>Struct::X</code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
