However, the alignment of this type is always equal to its size, even on targets where <code>T</code> has alignment less than its size.</p> <p>For more about the differences between atomic types and non-atomic types as well as information about the portability of this type, please see the <a href="index" title="mod std::sync::atomic">module-level documentation</a>.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This type is only available on platforms that support atomic loads and stores of <code>T</code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
