The exact liveness duration is not specified, but some bounds exist:</p> <ul> <li>For references, the liveness duration is upper-bounded by the syntactic lifetime assigned by the borrow checker; it cannot be live any <em>longer</em> than that lifetime.</li> <li>Each time a reference or box is dereferenced or reborrowed, it is considered live.</li> <li>Each time a reference or box is passed to or returned from a function, it is considered live.</li> <li>When a reference (but not a <code>Box</code>!) is passed to a function, it is live at least as long as that function call, again except if the <code>&amp;T</code> contains an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html"><code>UnsafeCell&lt;U&gt;</code></a>.</li> </ul> <p>All this also applies when values of these types are passed in a (nested) field of a compound type, but not behind pointer indirections.</p> </li> </ul>  <ul> <li> <p>Mutating immutable bytes.

(If there is no <code>*</code> projection in the place expression, then this is accessing the field of a local or <code>static</code> and rustc will guarantee proper alignment. If there are multiple <code>*</code> projection, then each of them incurs a load of the pointer-to-be-dereferenced itself from memory, and each of these loads is subject to the alignment constraint. Note that some <code>*</code> projections can be omitted in surface Rust syntax due to automatic dereferencing; we are considering the fully expanded place expression here.)</p> <p>For instance, if <code>ptr</code> has type <code>*const S</code> where <code>S</code> has an alignment of 8, then <code>ptr</code> must be 8-aligned or else <code>(*ptr).f</code> is “based on an misaligned pointer”. This is true even if the type of the field <code>f</code> is <code>u8</code> (i.e., a type with alignment 1). In other words, the alignment requirement derives from the type of the pointer that was dereferenced, <em>not</em> the type of the field that is being accessed.</p>  <p>Note that a place based on a misaligned pointer only leads to Undefined Behavior when it is loaded from or stored to.</p>  <p><code>&amp;raw const</code>/<code>&amp;raw mut</code> on such a place is allowed.</p>  <p><code>&amp;</code>/<code>&amp;mut</code> on a place requires the alignment of the field type (or else the program would be “producing an invalid value”), which generally is a less restrictive requirement than being based on an aligned pointer.</p>  <p>Taking a reference will lead to a compiler error in cases where the field type might be more aligned than the type that contains it, i.e., <code>repr(packed)</code>. This means that being based on an aligned pointer is always sufficient to ensure that the new reference is aligned, but it is not always necessary.</p>  <h2 id="dangling-pointers">Dangling pointers</h2>  <p>A reference/pointer is “dangling” if not all of the bytes it <a href="#pointed-to-bytes">points to</a> are part of the same live allocation (so in particular they all have to be part of <em>some</em> allocation).</p>  <p>If the size is 0, then the pointer is trivially never “dangling” (even if it is a null pointer).</p>  <p>Note that dynamically sized types (such as slices and strings) point to their entire range, so it is important that the length metadata is never too large.</p>  <p>In particular, the dynamic size of a Rust value (as determined by <code>size_of_val</code>) must never exceed <code>isize::MAX</code>, since it is impossible for a single allocation to be larger than <code>isize::MAX</code>.</p>  <h2 id="invalid-values">Invalid values</h2>  <p>The Rust compiler assumes that all values produced during program execution are “valid”, and producing an invalid value is hence immediate UB.</p> <p>Whether a value is valid depends on the type:</p>  <ul> <li>A <a href="types/boolean"><code>bool</code></a> value must be <code>false</code> (<code>0</code>) or <code>true</code> (<code>1</code>).</li> </ul>  <ul> <li>A <code>fn</code> pointer value must be non-null.</li> </ul>  <ul> <li>A <code>char</code> value must not be a surrogate (i.e., must not be in the range <code>0xD800..=0xDFFF</code>) and must be equal to or less than <code>char::MAX</code>.</li> </ul>  <ul> <li>A <code>!</code> value must never exist.</li> </ul>  <ul> <li>An integer (<code>i*</code>/<code>u*</code>), floating point value (<code>f*</code>), or raw pointer must be initialized, i.e., must not be obtained from uninitialized memory.</li> </ul>  <ul> <li>A <code>str</code> value is treated like <code>[u8]</code>, i.e. it must be initialized.</li> </ul>  <ul> <li>An <code>enum</code> must have a valid discriminant, and all fields of the variant indicated by that discriminant must be valid at their respective type.</li> </ul>  <ul> <li>A <code>struct</code>, tuple, and array requires all fields/elements to be valid at their respective type.</li> </ul>  <ul> <li>For a <code>union</code>, the exact validity requirements are not decided yet.
