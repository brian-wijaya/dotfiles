<h1 id="error-code-e0029">Error code E0029</h1> <p>Something other than numbers and characters has been used for a range.</p> <p>Erroneous code example:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let string = "salutations !";

// The ordering relation for strings cannot be evaluated at compile time,
// so this doesn't work:
match string {
    "hello" ..= "world" =&gt; {}
    _ =&gt; {}
}

// This is a more general version, using a guard:
match string {
    s if s &gt;= "hello" &amp;&amp; s &lt;= "world" =&gt; {}
    _ =&gt; {}
}
}</pre> <p>In a match expression, only numbers and characters can be matched against a range. This is because the compiler checks that the range is non-empty at compile-time, and is unable to evaluate arbitrary comparison functions. If you want to capture values of an orderable type between two end-points, you can use a guard.</p><div class="_attribution">
