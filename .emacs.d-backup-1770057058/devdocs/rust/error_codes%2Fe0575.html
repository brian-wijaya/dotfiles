<h1 id="error-code-e0575">Error code E0575</h1> <p>Something other than a type or an associated type was given.</p> <p>Erroneous code example:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
enum Rick { Morty }

let _: &lt;u8 as Rick&gt;::Morty; // error!

trait Age {
    type Empire;
    fn Mythology() {}
}

impl Age for u8 {
    type Empire = u16;
}

let _: &lt;u8 as Age&gt;::Mythology; // error!
}</pre> <p>In both cases, we're declaring a variable (called <code>_</code>) and we're giving it a type. However, <code>&lt;u8 as Rick&gt;::Morty</code> and <code>&lt;u8 as Age&gt;::Mythology</code> aren't types, therefore the compiler throws an error.</p> <p><code>&lt;u8 as Rick&gt;::Morty</code> is an enum variant, you cannot use a variant as a type, you have to use the enum directly:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
enum Rick { Morty }

let _: Rick; // ok!
}</pre> <p><code>&lt;u8 as Age&gt;::Mythology</code> is a trait method, which is definitely not a type. However, the <code>Age</code> trait provides an associated type <code>Empire</code> which can be used as a type:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
trait Age {
    type Empire;
    fn Mythology() {}
}

impl Age for u8 {
    type Empire = u16;
}

let _: &lt;u8 as Age&gt;::Empire; // ok!
