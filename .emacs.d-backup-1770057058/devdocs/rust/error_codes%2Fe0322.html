<h1 id="error-code-e0322">Error code E0322</h1> <p>A built-in trait was implemented explicitly. All implementations of the trait are provided automatically by the compiler.</p> <p>Erroneous code example:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
struct Foo;

impl Sized for Foo {} // error!
}</pre> <p>The <code>Sized</code> trait is a special trait built-in to the compiler for types with a constant size known at compile-time. This trait is automatically implemented for types as needed by the compiler, and it is currently disallowed to explicitly implement it for a type.</p><div class="_attribution">
