<h1 id="publishing-a-crate-to-cratesio">Publishing a Crate to Crates.io</h1> <p>We’ve used packages from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> as dependencies of our project, but you can also share your code with other people by publishing your own packages. The crate registry at <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> distributes the source code of your packages, so it primarily hosts code that is open source.</p> <p>Rust and Cargo have features that make your published package easier for people to find and use. We’ll talk about some of these features next and then explain how to publish a package.</p> <h3 id="making-useful-documentation-comments">Making Useful Documentation Comments</h3> <p>Accurately documenting your packages will help other users know how and when to use them, so it’s worth investing the time to write documentation. In Chapter 3, we discussed how to comment Rust code using two slashes, <code>//</code>. Rust also has a particular kind of comment for documentation, known conveniently as a <em>documentation comment</em>, that will generate HTML documentation. The HTML displays the contents of documentation comments for public API items intended for programmers interested in knowing how to <em>use</em> your crate as opposed to how your crate is <em>implemented</em>.</p> <p>Documentation comments use three slashes, <code>///</code>, instead of two and support Markdown notation for formatting the text. Place documentation comments just before the item they’re documenting. Listing 14-1 shows documentation comments for an <code>add_one</code> function in a crate named <code>my_crate</code>.</p> <figure class="listing" id="listing-14-1"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">/// Adds one to the number given.

///
/// assert_eq!(6, answer);
/// ```
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}</pre> <figcaption><a href="#listing-14-1">Listing 14-1</a>: A documentation comment for a function</figcaption> </figure> <p>Here, we give a description of what the <code>add_one</code> function does, start a section with the heading <code>Examples</code>, and then provide code that demonstrates how to use the <code>add_one</code> function. We can generate the HTML documentation from this documentation comment by running <code>cargo doc</code>. This command runs the <code>rustdoc</code> tool distributed with Rust and puts the generated HTML documentation in the <em>target/doc</em> directory.</p> <p>For convenience, running <code>cargo doc --open</code> will build the HTML for your current crate’s documentation (as well as the documentation for all of your crate’s dependencies) and open the result in a web browser. Navigate to the <code>add_one</code> function and you’ll see how the text in the documentation comments is rendered, as shown in Figure 14-1.</p> <img alt="Rendered HTML documentation for the `add_one` function of `my_crate`" src="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl14-01.png" class="center"> <p><span class="caption">Figure 14-1: HTML documentation for the <code>add_one</code> function</span></p> <h4 id="commonly-used-sections">Commonly Used Sections</h4> <p>We used the <code># Examples</code> Markdown heading in Listing 14-1 to create a section in the HTML with the title “Examples.” Here are some other sections that crate authors commonly use in their documentation:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>Panics</strong>: The scenarios in which the function being documented could panic. Callers of the function who don’t want their programs to panic should make sure they don’t call the function in these situations.</li> <li>
<strong>Errors</strong>: If the function returns a <code>Result</code>, describing the kinds of errors that might occur and what conditions might cause those errors to be returned can be helpful to callers so they can write code to handle the different kinds of errors in different ways.</li> <li>
<strong>Safety</strong>: If the function is <code>unsafe</code> to call (we discuss unsafety in Chapter 20), there should be a section explaining why the function is unsafe and covering the invariants that the function expects callers to uphold.</li> </ul> <p>Most documentation comments don’t need all of these sections, but this is a good checklist to remind you of the aspects of your code users will be interested in knowing about.</p> <h4 id="documentation-comments-as-tests">Documentation Comments as Tests</h4> <p>Adding example code blocks in your documentation comments can help demonstrate how to use your library, and doing so has an additional bonus: running <code>cargo test</code> will run the code examples in your documentation as tests! Nothing is better than documentation with examples. But nothing is worse than examples that don’t work because the code has changed since the documentation was written. If we run <code>cargo test</code> with the documentation for the <code>add_one</code> function from Listing 14-1, we will see a section in the test results that looks like this:</p>  <pre>   Doc-tests my_crate

running 1 test
test src/lib.rs - add_one (line 5) ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.27s
</pre> <p>Now, if we change either the function or the example so the <code>assert_eq!</code> in the example panics, and run <code>cargo test</code> again, we’ll see that the doc tests catch that the example and the code are out of sync with each other!</p> <h4 id="commenting-contained-items">Commenting Contained Items</h4> <p>The style of doc comment <code>//!</code> adds documentation to the item that <em>contains</em> the comments rather than to the items <em>following</em> the comments. We typically use these doc comments inside the crate root file (<em>src/lib.rs</em> by convention) or inside a module to document the crate or the module as a whole.</p> <p>For example, to add documentation that describes the purpose of the <code>my_crate</code> crate that contains the <code>add_one</code> function, we add documentation comments that start with <code>//!</code> to the beginning of the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file, as shown in Listing 14-2.</p> <figure class="listing" id="listing-14-2"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">//! # My Crate

}</pre> <figcaption><a href="#listing-14-2">Listing 14-2</a>: Documentation for the <code>my_crate</code> crate as a whole</figcaption> </figure> <p>Notice there isn’t any code after the last line that begins with <code>//!</code>. Because we started the comments with <code>//!</code> instead of <code>///</code>, we’re documenting the item that contains this comment rather than an item that follows this comment. In this case, that item is the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file, which is the crate root. These comments describe the entire crate.</p> <p>When we run <code>cargo doc --open</code>, these comments will display on the front page of the documentation for <code>my_crate</code> above the list of public items in the crate, as shown in Figure 14-2.</p> <img alt="Rendered HTML documentation with a comment for the crate as a whole" src="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl14-02.png" class="center"> <p><span class="caption">Figure 14-2: Rendered documentation for <code>my_crate</code>, including the comment describing the crate as a whole</span></p> <p>Documentation comments within items are useful for describing crates and modules especially. Use them to explain the overall purpose of the container to help your users understand the crate’s organization.</p> <h3 id="exporting-a-convenient-public-api-with-pub-use">Exporting a Convenient Public API with <code id="">pub use</code>
</h3> <p>The structure of your public API is a major consideration when publishing a crate. People who use your crate are less familiar with the structure than you are and might have difficulty finding the pieces they want to use if your crate has a large module hierarchy.</p> <p>In Chapter 7, we covered how to make items public using the <code>pub</code> keyword, and how to bring items into a scope with the <code>use</code> keyword. However, the structure that makes sense to you while you’re developing a crate might not be very convenient for your users. You might want to organize your structs in a hierarchy containing multiple levels, but then people who want to use a type you’ve defined deep in the hierarchy might have trouble finding out that type exists. They might also be annoyed at having to enter <code>use my_crate::some_module::another_module::UsefulType;</code> rather than <code>use my_crate::UsefulType;</code>.</p> <p>The good news is that if the structure <em>isn’t</em> convenient for others to use from another library, you don’t have to rearrange your internal organization: instead, you can re-export items to make a public structure that’s different from your private structure by using <code>pub use</code>. <em>Re-exporting</em> takes a public item in one location and makes it public in another location, as if it were defined in the other location instead.</p> <p>For example, say we made a library named <code>art</code> for modeling artistic concepts. Within this library are two modules: a <code>kinds</code> module containing two enums named <code>PrimaryColor</code> and <code>SecondaryColor</code> and a <code>utils</code> module containing a function named <code>mix</code>, as shown in Listing 14-3.</p> <figure class="listing" id="listing-14-3"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">//! # Art

We have to click <code>kinds</code> and <code>utils</code> to see them.</p> <p>Another crate that depends on this library would need <code>use</code> statements that bring the items from <code>art</code> into scope, specifying the module structure that’s currently defined. Listing 14-4 shows an example of a crate that uses the <code>PrimaryColor</code> and <code>mix</code> items from the <code>art</code> crate.</p> <figure class="listing" id="listing-14-4"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/main.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">use art::kinds::PrimaryColor;

The module structure of the <code>art</code> crate is more relevant to developers working on the <code>art</code> crate than to those using it. The internal structure doesn’t contain any useful information for someone trying to understand how to use the <code>art</code> crate, but rather causes confusion because developers who use it have to figure out where to look, and must specify the module names in the <code>use</code> statements.</p> <p>To remove the internal organization from the public API, we can modify the <code>art</code> crate code in Listing 14-3 to add <code>pub use</code> statements to re-export the items at the top level, as shown in Listing 14-5.</p> <figure class="listing" id="listing-14-5"> <span class="file-name">Filename: src/lib.rs</span> <pre data-language="rust">//! # Art

Another common use of <code>pub use</code> is to re-export definitions of a dependency in the current crate to make that crate’s definitions part of your crate’s public API.</p> <p>Creating a useful public API structure is more of an art than a science, and you can iterate to find the API that works best for your users. Choosing <code>pub use</code> gives you flexibility in how you structure your crate internally and decouples that internal structure from what you present to your users. Look at some of the code of crates you’ve installed to see if their internal structure differs from their public API.</p> <h3 id="setting-up-a-cratesio-account">Setting Up a Crates.io Account</h3> <p>Before you can publish any crates, you need to create an account on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> and get an API token. To do so, visit the home page at <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> and log in via a GitHub account. (The GitHub account is currently a requirement, but the site might support other ways of creating an account in the future.) Once you’re logged in, visit your account settings at <a href="https://crates.io/me/">https://crates.io/me/</a> and retrieve your API key. Then run the <code>cargo login</code> command and paste your API key when prompted, like this:</p> <pre>$ cargo login
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345
</pre> <p>This command will inform Cargo of your API token and store it locally in <em>~/.cargo/credentials.toml</em>. Note that this token is a <em>secret</em>: do not share it with anyone else. If you do share it with anyone for any reason, you should revoke it and generate a new token on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>.</p> <h3 id="adding-metadata-to-a-new-crate">Adding Metadata to a New Crate</h3> <p>Let’s say you have a crate you want to publish. Before publishing, you’ll need to add some metadata in the <code>[package]</code> section of the crate’s <em>Cargo.toml</em> file.</p> <p>Your crate will need a unique name. While you’re working on a crate locally, you can name a crate whatever you’d like. However, crate names on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Once a crate name is taken, no one else can publish a crate with that name. Before attempting to publish a crate, search for the name you want to use. If the name has been used, you will need to find another name and edit the <code>name</code> field in the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file under the <code>[package]</code> section to use the new name for publishing, like so:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p> <pre>[package]
name = "guessing_game"
</pre> <p>Even if you’ve chosen a unique name, when you run <code>cargo publish</code> to publish the crate at this point, you’ll get a warning and then an error:</p>  <pre>$ cargo publish

error: failed to publish to registry at https://crates.io

Caused by:
  the remote server responded with an error (status 400 Bad Request): missing or empty metadata fields: description, license. Please see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html for more information on configuring these fields
</pre> <p>This results in an error because you’re missing some crucial information: a description and license are required so people will know what your crate does and under what terms they can use it. In <em>Cargo.toml</em>, add a description that’s just a sentence or two, because it will appear with your crate in search results. For the <code>license</code> field, you need to give a <em>license identifier value</em>. The <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/">Linux Foundation’s Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)</a> lists the identifiers you can use for this value. For example, to specify that you’ve licensed your crate using the MIT License, add the <code>MIT</code> identifier:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p> <pre>[package]
name = "guessing_game"
license = "MIT"
</pre> <p>If you want to use a license that doesn’t appear in the SPDX, you need to place the text of that license in a file, include the file in your project, and then use <code>license-file</code> to specify the name of that file instead of using the <code>license</code> key.</p> <p>Guidance on which license is appropriate for your project is beyond the scope of this book. Many people in the Rust community license their projects in the same way as Rust by using a dual license of <code>MIT OR Apache-2.0</code>. This practice demonstrates that you can also specify multiple license identifiers separated by <code>OR</code> to have multiple licenses for your project.</p> <p>With a unique name, the version, your description, and a license added, the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file for a project that is ready to publish might look like this:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p> <pre>[package]
name = "guessing_game"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"
description = "A fun game where you guess what number the computer has chosen."
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"

</pre> <p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo’s documentation</a> describes other metadata you can specify to ensure that others can discover and use your crate more easily.</p> <h3 id="publishing-to-cratesio">Publishing to Crates.io</h3> <p>Now that you’ve created an account, saved your API token, chosen a name for your crate, and specified the required metadata, you’re ready to publish! Publishing a crate uploads a specific version to <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> for others to use.</p> <p>Be careful, because a publish is <em>permanent</em>. The version can never be overwritten, and the code cannot be deleted except in certain circumstances. One major goal of Crates.io is to act as a permanent archive of code so that builds of all projects that depend on crates from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> will continue to work. Allowing version deletions would make fulfilling that goal impossible. However, there is no limit to the number of crate versions you can publish.</p> <p>Run the <code>cargo publish</code> command again. It should succeed now:</p>  <pre>$ cargo publish

</pre> <p>Congratulations! You’ve now shared your code with the Rust community, and anyone can easily add your crate as a dependency of their project.</p> <h3 id="publishing-a-new-version-of-an-existing-crate">Publishing a New Version of an Existing Crate</h3> <p>When you’ve made changes to your crate and are ready to release a new version, you change the <code>version</code> value specified in your <em>Cargo.toml</em> file and republish. Use the <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning rules</a> to decide what an appropriate next version number is, based on the kinds of changes you’ve made. Then run <code>cargo publish</code> to upload the new version.</p>   <h3 id="deprecating-versions-from-cratesio-with-cargo-yank">Deprecating Versions from Crates.io with <code id="">cargo yank</code>
</h3> <p>Although you can’t remove previous versions of a crate, you can prevent any future projects from adding them as a new dependency. This is useful when a crate version is broken for one reason or another. In such situations, Cargo supports yanking a crate version.</p> <p><em>Yanking</em> a version prevents new projects from depending on that version while allowing all existing projects that depend on it to continue. Essentially, a yank means that all projects with a <em>Cargo.lock</em> will not break, and any future <em>Cargo.lock</em> files generated will not use the yanked version.</p> <p>To yank a version of a crate, in the directory of the crate that you’ve previously published, run <code>cargo yank</code> and specify which version you want to yank. For example, if we’ve published a crate named <code>guessing_game</code> version 1.0.1 and we want to yank it, in the project directory for <code>guessing_game</code> we’d run:</p>  <pre>$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1
    Updating crates.io index
        Yank guessing_game@1.0.1
</pre> <p>By adding <code>--undo</code> to the command, you can also undo a yank and allow projects to start depending on a version again:</p> <pre>$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1 --undo
    Updating crates.io index
      Unyank guessing_game@1.0.1
</pre> <p>A yank <em>does not</em> delete any code. It cannot, for example, delete accidentally uploaded secrets. If that happens, you must reset those secrets immediately.</p><div class="_attribution">
