<h1 class="main-heading">Function pipe </h1>
<pre class="rust item-decl" data-language="rust">pub fn pipe() -&gt; Result&lt;(PipeReader, PipeWriter)&gt;</pre>
<p>Creates an anonymous pipe.</p> <h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2> <p>A pipe is a one-way data channel provided by the OS, which works across processes. A pipe is typically used to communicate between two or more separate processes, as there are better, faster ways to communicate within a single process.</p> <p>In particular:</p> <ul> <li>A read on a <a href="struct.pipereader" title="struct std::io::PipeReader"><code>PipeReader</code></a> blocks until the pipe is non-empty.</li> <li>A write on a <a href="struct.pipewriter" title="struct std::io::PipeWriter"><code>PipeWriter</code></a> blocks when the pipe is full.</li> <li>When all copies of a <a href="struct.pipewriter" title="struct std::io::PipeWriter"><code>PipeWriter</code></a> are closed, a read on the corresponding <a href="struct.pipereader" title="struct std::io::PipeReader"><code>PipeReader</code></a> returns EOF.</li> <li>
<a href="struct.pipewriter" title="struct std::io::PipeWriter"><code>PipeWriter</code></a> can be shared, and multiple processes or threads can write to it at once, but writes (above a target-specific threshold) may have their data interleaved.</li> <li>
<a href="struct.pipereader" title="struct std::io::PipeReader"><code>PipeReader</code></a> can be shared, and multiple processes or threads can read it at once. Any given byte will only get consumed by one reader. There are no guarantees about data interleaving.</li> <li>Portable applications cannot assume any atomicity of messages larger than a single byte.</li> </ul> <h2 id="platform-specific-behavior">Platform-specific behavior</h2> <p>This function currently corresponds to the <code>pipe</code> function on Unix and the <code>CreatePipe</code> function on Windows.</p> <p>Note that this <a href="index#platform-specific-behavior" title="mod std::io">may change in the future</a>.</p> <h2 id="capacity">Capacity</h2> <p>Pipe capacity is platform dependent. To quote the Linux <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pipe.7.html">man page</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Different implementations have different limits for the pipe capacity. Applications should not rely on a particular capacity: an application should be designed so that a reading process consumes data as soon as it is available, so that a writing process does not remain blocked.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">use std::io::{Read, Write, pipe};

// Send input to the child process. Note that because we're writing all the input before we

// `cat` exits when it reads EOF from stdin, but that can't happen while any ping writer
// remains open. We need to drop our ping writer, or read_to_string will deadlock below.
drop(ping_writer);

// The pong reader can't report EOF while any pong writer remains open. Our Command object is
// holding a pong writer, and again read_to_string will deadlock if we don't drop it.
