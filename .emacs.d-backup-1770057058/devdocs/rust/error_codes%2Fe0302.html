<h1 id="error-code-e0302">Error code E0302</h1> <h4 id="note-this-error-code-is-no-longer-emitted-by-the-compiler">Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.</h4> <p>Assignments are not allowed in pattern guards, because matching cannot have side effects. Side effects could alter the matched object or the environment on which the match depends in such a way, that the match would not be exhaustive. For instance, the following would not match any arm if assignments were allowed:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
match Some(()) {
    None =&gt; { },
    option if { option = None; false } =&gt; { },
    Some(_) =&gt; { } // When the previous match failed, the option became `None`.
}
