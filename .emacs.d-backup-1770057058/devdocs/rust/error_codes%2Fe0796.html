<h1 id="error-code-e0796">Error code E0796</h1> <h4 id="note-this-error-code-is-no-longer-emitted-by-the-compiler">Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.</h4> <p>You have created a reference to a mutable static.</p> <p>Erroneous code example:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
static mut X: i32 = 23;
fn work() {
  let _val = unsafe { X };
}
let x_ref = unsafe { &amp;mut X };
work();
// The next line has Undefined Behavior!
// `x_ref` is a mutable reference and allows no aliases,
// but `work` has been reading the reference between
// the moment `x_ref` was created and when it was used.
// This violates the uniqueness of `x_ref`.
*x_ref = 42;
}</pre> <p>A reference to a mutable static has lifetime <code>'static</code>. This is very dangerous as it is easy to accidentally overlap the lifetime of that reference with other, conflicting accesses to the same static.</p> <p>References to mutable statics are a hard error in the 2024 edition.</p><div class="_attribution">
