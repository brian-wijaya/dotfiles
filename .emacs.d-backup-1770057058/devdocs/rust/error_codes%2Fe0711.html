fn main() {
// NOTE: this attribute is perma-unstable and should *never* be used outside of
//       stdlib and the compiler.
#![feature(staged_api)]

#![stable(feature = "...", since = "1.0.0")]

#[stable(feature = "foo", since = "1.0.0")]
fn foo_stable_1_0_0() {}

// error: feature `foo` is declared stable since 1.29.0
#[stable(feature = "foo", since = "1.29.0")]

// error: feature `foo` is declared unstable
#[unstable(feature = "foo", issue = "none")]

}</pre> <p>In the above example, the <code>foo</code> feature is first defined to be stable since 1.0.0, but is then re-declared stable since 1.29.0. This discrepancy in versions causes an error. Furthermore, <code>foo</code> is then re-declared as unstable, again the conflict causes an error.</p> <p>This error can be fixed by splitting the feature, this allows any stability requirements and removes any possibility of conflict.</p><div class="_attribution">
