<h1 id="error-code-e0472">Error code E0472</h1> <p>Inline assembly (<code>asm!</code>) is not supported on this target.</p> <p>Example of erroneous code:</p> <pre data-language="rust">// compile-flags: --target sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu
#![no_std]

use core::arch::asm;

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        asm!(""); // error: inline assembly is not supported on this target
    }
}</pre> <p>The Rust compiler does not support inline assembly, with the <code>asm!</code> macro (previously <code>llvm_asm!</code>), for all targets. All Tier 1 targets do support this macro but support among Tier 2 and 3 targets is not guaranteed (even when they have <code>std</code> support). Note that this error is related to <code>error[E0658]: inline assembly is not stable yet on this architecture</code>, but distinct in that with <code>E0472</code> support is not planned or in progress.</p> <p>There is no way to easily fix this issue, however:</p> <ul> <li>Consider if you really need inline assembly, is there some other way to achieve your goal (intrinsics, etc)?</li> <li>Consider writing your assembly externally, linking with it and calling it from Rust.</li> <li>Consider contributing to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust</a> and help integrate support for your target!</li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
