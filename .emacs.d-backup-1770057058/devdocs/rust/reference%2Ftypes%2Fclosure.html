 <h1 id="closure-types">Closure types</h1>  <p>A <a href="../expressions/closure-expr">closure expression</a> produces a closure value with a unique, anonymous type that cannot be written out. A closure type is approximately equivalent to a struct which contains the captured values. For instance, the following closure:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }
struct Rectangle { left_top: Point, right_bottom: Point }

    println!("{}", g());
}

let mut rect = Rectangle {
    left_top: Point { x: 1, y: 1 },
    right_bottom: Point { x: 0, y: 0 }
};

let c = || {
    rect.left_top.x += 1;
    rect.right_bottom.x += 1;
    format!("{:?}", rect.left_top)
};
f(c); // Prints "Point { x: 2, y: 1 }".
}</pre> <p>generates a closure type roughly like the following:</p>  <pre data-language="rust">// Note: This is not exactly how it is translated, this is only for
// illustration.

struct Closure&lt;'a&gt; {
    left_top : &amp;'a mut Point,

fn main() {
struct SomeStruct {
    f1: (i32, i32),
}
let s = SomeStruct { f1: (1, 2) };

let c = || {
    let x = s.f1.1; // s.f1.1 captured by ImmBorrow
};
c();
}</pre> <p>Here the capture path is the local variable <code>s</code>, followed by a field access <code>.f1</code>, and then a tuple index <code>.1</code>. This closure captures an immutable borrow of <code>s.f1.1</code>.</p>  <h3 id="shared-prefix">Shared prefix</h3> <p>In the case where a capture path and one of the ancestor’s of that path are both captured by a closure, the ancestor path is captured with the highest capture mode among the two captures, <code>CaptureMode = max(AncestorCaptureMode, DescendantCaptureMode)</code>, using the strict weak ordering:</p> <p><code>ImmBorrow &lt; UniqueImmBorrow &lt; MutBorrow &lt; ByValue</code></p> <p>Note that this might need to be applied recursively.</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
// In this example, there are three different capture paths with a shared ancestor:

};

}</pre> <p>Overall this closure will capture <code>u</code> by <code>ByValue</code>.</p>  <h3 id="rightmost-shared-reference-truncation">Rightmost shared reference truncation</h3> <p>The capture path is truncated at the rightmost dereference in the capture path if the dereference is applied to a shared reference.</p> <p>This truncation is allowed because fields that are read through a shared reference will always be read via a shared reference or a copy. This helps reduce the size of the capture when the extra precision does not yield any benefit from a borrow checking perspective.</p> <p>The reason it is the <em>rightmost</em> dereference is to help avoid a shorter lifetime than is necessary. Consider the following example:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
struct Int(i32);
struct B&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a i32);

struct MyStruct&lt;'a&gt; {

    let c = || drop(&amp;m.a.0);
    c
}
}</pre> <p>If this were to capture <code>m</code>, then the closure would no longer outlive <code>'static</code>, since <code>m</code> is constrained to <code>'a</code>. Instead, it captures <code>(*(*m).a)</code> by <code>ImmBorrow</code>.</p>  <h3 id="wildcard-pattern-bindings">Wildcard pattern bindings</h3> <p>Closures only capture data that needs to be read. Binding a value with a <a href="../patterns#wildcard-pattern">wildcard pattern</a> does not count as a read, and thus won’t be captured. For example, the following closures will not capture <code>x</code>:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let x = String::from("hello");
let c = || {
    let _ = x;  // x is not captured
};
c();

let c = || match x {  // x is not captured
    _ =&gt; println!("Hello World!")
};
c();
}</pre> <p>This also includes destructuring of tuples, structs, and enums. Fields matched with the <a href="../patterns#grammar-RestPattern">RestPattern</a> or <a href="../patterns#grammar-StructPatternEtCetera">StructPatternEtCetera</a> are also not considered as read, and thus those fields will not be captured. The following illustrates some of these:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let x = (String::from("a"), String::from("b"));
let c = || {
    let (first, ..) = x;  // captures `x.0` ByValue

};
// Field f2 cannot be accessed since it is moved into the closure.
// Field f1 is still accessible.
println!("{:?}", e.f1);
c();
}</pre>  <p>Partial captures of arrays and slices are not supported; the entire slice or array is always captured even if used with wildcard pattern matching, indexing, or sub-slicing. For example:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
#[derive(Debug)]

let x = [Example, Example];

let c = || {

}</pre>  <h2 id="edition-2018-and-before">Edition 2018 and before</h2> <h3 id="closure-types-difference">Closure types difference</h3> <p>In Edition 2018 and before, closures always capture a variable in its entirety, without its precise capture path. This means that for the example used in the <a href="#closure-types">Closure types</a> section, the generated closure type would instead look something like this:</p>  <pre data-language="rust">struct Closure&lt;'a&gt; {
    rect : &amp;'a mut Rectangle,
}

impl&lt;'a&gt; FnOnce&lt;()&gt; for Closure&lt;'a&gt; {
    type Output = String;
    extern "rust-call" fn call_once(self, args: ()) -&gt; String {
        self.rect.left_top.x += 1;
        self.rect.right_bottom.x += 1;
        format!("{:?}", self.rect.left_top)
    }
}</pre> <p>and the call to <code>f</code> would work as follows:</p>  <pre data-language="rust">f(Closure { rect: rect });</pre>  <h3 id="capture-precision-difference">Capture precision difference</h3> <p>Composite types such as structs, tuples, and enums are always captured in its entirety, not by individual fields. As a result, it may be necessary to borrow into a local variable in order to capture a single field:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
use std::collections::HashSet;

struct SetVec {
    set: HashSet&lt;u32&gt;,
    vec: Vec&lt;u32&gt;
}

impl SetVec {
    fn populate(&amp;mut self) {
        let vec = &amp;mut self.vec;
        self.set.iter().for_each(|&amp;n| {
            vec.push(n);
        })
    }
}
}</pre> <p>If, instead, the closure were to use <code>self.vec</code> directly, then it would attempt to capture <code>self</code> by mutable reference. But since <code>self.set</code> is already borrowed to iterate over, the code would not compile.</p>  <p>If the <code>move</code> keyword is used, then all captures are by move or, for <code>Copy</code> types, by copy, regardless of whether a borrow would work. The <code>move</code> keyword is usually used to allow the closure to outlive the captured values, such as if the closure is being returned or used to spawn a new thread.</p>  <p>Regardless of if the data will be read by the closure, i.e. in case of wild card patterns, if a variable defined outside the closure is mentioned within the closure the variable will be captured in its entirety.</p>  <h3 id="drop-order-difference">Drop order difference</h3> <p>As composite types are captured in their entirety, a closure which captures one of those composite types by value would drop the entire captured variable at the same time as the closure gets dropped.</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]

{
    let tuple =
      (String::from("foo"), String::from("bar"));
