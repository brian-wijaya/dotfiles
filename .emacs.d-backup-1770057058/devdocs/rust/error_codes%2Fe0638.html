<h1 id="error-code-e0638">Error code E0638</h1> <p>This error indicates that the struct, enum or enum variant must be matched non-exhaustively as it has been marked as <code>non_exhaustive</code>.</p> <p>When applied within a crate, downstream users of the crate will need to use the <code>_</code> pattern when matching enums and use the <code>..</code> pattern when matching structs. Downstream crates cannot match against non-exhaustive enum variants.</p> <p>For example, in the below example, since the enum is marked as <code>non_exhaustive</code>, it is required that downstream crates match non-exhaustively on it.</p> <pre data-language="rust">#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum Error {
    Message(String),
    Other,
}

impl Display for Error {
    fn fmt(&amp;self, formatter: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter) -&gt; fmt::Result {
        // This will not error, despite being marked as non_exhaustive, as this
        // enum is defined within the current crate, it can be matched
        // exhaustively.
        let display = match self {
            Message(s) =&gt; s,
            Other =&gt; "other or unknown error",
        };
        formatter.write_str(display)
    }
}</pre> <p>An example of matching non-exhaustively on the above enum is provided below:</p> <pre data-language="rust">use mycrate::Error;

// This will not error as the non_exhaustive Error enum has been matched with a
// wildcard.
match error {
    Message(s) =&gt; ...,
    Other =&gt; ...,
    _ =&gt; ...,
}</pre> <p>Similarly, for structs, match with <code>..</code> to avoid this error.</p><div class="_attribution">
