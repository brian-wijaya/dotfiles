<h1 id="error-code-e0697">Error code E0697</h1> <p>A closure has been used as <code>static</code>.</p> <p>Erroneous code example:</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    static || {}; // used as `static`
}</pre> <p>Closures cannot be used as <code>static</code>. They "save" the environment, and as such a static closure would save only a static environment which would consist only of variables with a static lifetime. Given this it would be better to use a proper function. The easiest fix is to remove the <code>static</code> keyword.</p><div class="_attribution">
