<h1 id="error-code-e0133">Error code E0133</h1> <p>Unsafe code was used outside of an unsafe block.</p> <p>Erroneous code example:</p> <pre data-language="rust">unsafe fn f() { return; } // This is the unsafe code

fn main() {
    f(); // error: call to unsafe function requires unsafe function or block
}</pre> <p>Using unsafe functionality is potentially dangerous and disallowed by safety checks. Examples:</p> <ul> <li>Dereferencing raw pointers</li> <li>Calling functions via FFI</li> <li>Calling functions marked unsafe</li> </ul> <p>These safety checks can be relaxed for a section of the code by wrapping the unsafe instructions with an <code>unsafe</code> block. For instance:</p> <pre data-language="rust">unsafe fn f() { return; }

fn main() {
    unsafe { f(); } // ok!
}</pre> <p>See the <a href="../book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust">unsafe section</a> of the Book for more details.</p> <h4 id="unsafe-code-in-functions">Unsafe code in functions</h4> <p>Unsafe code is currently accepted in unsafe functions, but that is being phased out in favor of requiring unsafe blocks here too.</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
unsafe fn f() { return; }

unsafe fn g() {
    f(); // Is accepted, but no longer recommended
    unsafe { f(); } // Recommended way to write this
}
}</pre> <p>Linting against this is controlled via the <code>unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn</code> lint, which is <code>warn</code> by default in the 2024 edition and <code>allow</code> by default in earlier editions.</p><div class="_attribution">
