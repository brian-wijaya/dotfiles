<h1 id="error-code-e0502">Error code E0502</h1> <p>A variable already borrowed with a certain mutability (either mutable or immutable) was borrowed again with a different mutability.</p> <p>Erroneous code example:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
fn bar(x: &amp;mut i32) {}
fn foo(a: &amp;mut i32) {
    let y = &amp;a; // a is borrowed as immutable.
    bar(a); // error: cannot borrow `*a` as mutable because `a` is also borrowed
            //        as immutable
    println!("{}", y);
}
}</pre> <p>To fix this error, ensure that you don't have any other references to the variable before trying to access it with a different mutability:</p> <pre data-language="rust">#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
fn bar(x: &amp;mut i32) {}
fn foo(a: &amp;mut i32) {
    bar(a);
    let y = &amp;a; // ok!
    println!("{}", y);
}
