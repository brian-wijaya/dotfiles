<h1>Circular fixes detected …</h1>  <h2 id="symptoms" tabindex="-1">Symptoms</h2> <p>When running ESLint with the <code>--fix</code> option, you may see the following warning:</p> <div class="code-wrapper"> <pre class="language-plaintext line-numbers-mode"><code>ESLintCircularFixesWarning: Circular fixes detected while fixing path/to/file. It is likely that you have conflicting rules in your configuration.
</code></pre> <button class="copy-btn" aria-labelledby="copy-button-label"> <span hidden id="copy-button-label">Copy code to clipboard</span>  </button> </div> <h2 id="cause" tabindex="-1">Cause</h2> <p>You have conflicting fixable rules in your configuration. ESLint autofixes code in multiple passes, meaning it’s possible that a fix in one pass is undone in a subsequent pass. For example, in the first pass a rule removes a trailing comma and in the following pass a different rule adds a trailing comma in the same place, effectively changing the code back to the previous version. ESLint emits a warning when it detects cycles like this.</p> <h2 id="resolution" tabindex="-1">Resolution</h2> <p>Common resolutions for this issue include:</p> <ul> <li>Remove or reconfigure one of the conflicting rules in your configuration file.</li> </ul> <p>How to find the conflicting rules:</p> <ol> <li>Open the file specified in the warning in an editor that supports applying individual fixes (for example, VS Code).</li> <li>In the list of lint problems, find a fixable rule. That is one of the conflicting rules.</li> <li>Apply the fix (“Fix this (rule-name) problem” action in VS Code).</li> <li>Check what new lint problem has appeared in the list. That is the other conflicting rule.</li> </ol> <h2 id="resources" tabindex="-1">Resources</h2> <p>For more information, see:</p> <ul> <li>
