<h1>Overview of shapes</h1>  <section class="content-section">  <p>The <a href="../css_shapes">CSS Shapes module</a> describes geometric shapes in CSS. This article provides an overview of how you can use shapes to wrap text around floated elements that are not necessarily rectangular.</p> <p>When you float an item left, text will wrap around the right and bottom of the item in a rectangular fashion. With CSS shapes you can, for example, apply a circle shape, and the text will wrap around the line of the circle.</p> <p>There are several ways to create this circle. In this guide, we will look at how CSS Shapes work and how to use them.</p> </section>    <mdn-survey></mdn-survey> <section class="content-section" aria-labelledby="what_does_the_specification_define"> <h2 id="what_does_the_specification_define" class="heading">What does the specification define?</h2> <p>The specification defines a few properties, including:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="../shape-outside"><code>shape-outside</code></a> — Allows definition of basic shapes.</li> <li>
<a href="../shape-image-threshold"><code>shape-image-threshold</code></a> — Sets an opacity threshold value.

It takes a variety of values that define different shapes specified in the <a href="../basic-shape"><code>&lt;basic-shape&gt;</code></a> data type.</p> <p>In the following example, an image is floated to the left. We apply the <code>shape-outside</code> property with a <code>circle(50%)</code> value. The result is that the content now curves around the circular shape rather than following the rectangle created by the box of the image.</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="html">&lt;div class="box"&gt;

    One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat
    over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching the
    grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names
    were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and
    were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all
    scientific knowledge and new discovery. Before that night—a memorable night,
    as it was to prove—hundreds of millions of people had watched the rising
    smoke-wreaths of their fires without drawing any special inspiration from
    the fact.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

If we used a newer shape type that doesn't have full support, users of non-supporting browsers would see the content flowing around the sides of a rectangular, due to the image being floated. Shapes are a visual progressive enhancement.</p> </section><section class="content-section" aria-labelledby="basic_shapes"> <h3 id="basic_shapes" class="heading">Basic shapes</h3> <p>The value <code>circle(50%)</code> is an example of a basic shape. The specification defines several <code>&lt;basic-shape&gt;</code> values, including:</p> <ul> <li><a href="../basic-shape/circle"><code>circle()</code></a></li> <li><a href="../basic-shape/ellipse"><code>ellipse()</code></a></li> <li><a href="../basic-shape/inset"><code>inset()</code></a></li> <li><a href="../basic-shape/path"><code>path()</code></a></li> <li><a href="../basic-shape/polygon"><code>polygon()</code></a></li> <li><a href="../basic-shape/rect"><code>rect()</code></a></li> <li><a href="../basic-shape/shape"><code>shape()</code></a></li> <li><a href="../basic-shape/xywh"><code>xywh()</code></a></li> </ul> <p>Three of these functions only define rectangles. With the <code>inset()</code> function, you define four offset values, thus pulling the line boxes of any wrapping content closer to the object than they otherwise would. The <code>rect()</code> function defines a rectangle by specifying the distance from the top and left edges of the containing block. The <code>xywh()</code> function works by specifying distances from the top and left edges of the reference box and setting the width and height of the rectangle from that starting point.</p> <p>We have already seen how <code>circle()</code> creates a circular shape. An <code>ellipse()</code> is essentially a squashed circle. If none of these basic shapes do the trick you can create more complex shapes using the <code>polygon()</code> function, which allows the definition of a series of lines. The <code>path()</code> and <code>shape()</code> functions can be used to create ANY shape via a series of line, curve, and move commands.</p> <p>In our <a href="basic_shapes">Guide to Basic Shapes</a> we explore each of the possible Basic Shapes and how to create them.</p> </section><section class="content-section" aria-labelledby="shapes_from_the_box_value"> <h3 id="shapes_from_the_box_value" class="heading">Shapes from the box value</h3> <p>Shapes can also be created around the box value. Therefore, you could create your shape on:</p> <ul> <li><code>border-box</code></li> <li><code>padding-box</code></li> <li><code>content-box</code></li> <li><code>margin-box</code></li> </ul> <p>In the example below, you can change the value <code>border-box</code> to any of the other allowed values to see how the shape moves closer or further away from the box.</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="html">&lt;div class="box"&gt;

This allows the overlay of wrapped content around an image or the use of an image that is never displayed on the page purely as a method of creating a complex shape without needing to carefully map a polygon.</p> <p>Note that images used in this way must be <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS">CORS compatible</a>, otherwise <code>shape-outside</code> will act as if <code>none</code> had been given as the value, and you will get no shape.</p> <p>In this next example, we have an image with a fully transparent area, and we are using an image as the URL value for <code>shape-outside</code>.
