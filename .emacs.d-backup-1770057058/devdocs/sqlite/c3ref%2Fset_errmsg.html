      <h1>Set Error Codes And Message</h1>  <pre data-language="sql">
int sqlite3_set_errmsg(sqlite3 *db, int errcode, const char *zErrMsg);
</pre> <p> Set the error code of the database handle passed as the first argument to errcode, and the error message to a copy of nul-terminated string zErrMsg. If zErrMsg is passed NULL, then the error message is set to the default message associated with the supplied error code. Subsequent calls to <a href="errcode">sqlite3_errcode()</a> and <a href="errcode">sqlite3_errmsg()</a> and similar will return the values set by this routine in place of what was previously set by SQLite itself.</p> <p>This function returns SQLITE_OK if the error code and error message are successfully set, SQLITE_NOMEM if an OOM occurs, and SQLITE_MISUSE if the database handle is NULL or invalid.</p> <p>The error code and message set by this routine remains in effect until they are changed, either by another call to this routine or until they are changed to by SQLite itself to reflect the result of some subsquent API call.</p> <p>This function is intended for use by SQLite extensions or wrappers. The idea is that an extension or wrapper can use this routine to set error messages and error codes and thus behave more like a core SQLite feature from the point of view of an application. </p>
