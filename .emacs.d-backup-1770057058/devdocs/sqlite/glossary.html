<h1>Terms of Art Glossary</h1>   <p>This page contains a glossary of terms of art which appear, but are not defined, throughout this project's documentation. This page is <em>not</em> a tutorial, just a summary, and many related terms of art are not listed here. Countless web-hosted resources exist which cover, in detail, all of the terminology listed here. Interested readers are encouraged to feed these terms to their internet search engine of choice.</p> In alphabetical order: <ul> <li>

<strong>DQL: Data Query Language</strong> is the subset of SQL related to fetching results, i.e. <code>SELECT</code>. Whether <code>INSERT...RETURNING</code> also qualifies as DQL is a question left to those who define these terms formally. </li> <li>
