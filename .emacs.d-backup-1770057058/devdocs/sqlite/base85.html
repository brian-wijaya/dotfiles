     <h1 class="fancy_title"> The Base85() SQL Function </h1>  <h2 id="overview">
<span>1. </span>Overview</h2> <p> The base85() function is an SQL function implemented as a <a href="loadext">loadable extension</a> for SQLite. The function converts a binary BLOB into an equivalent base-85 text encoding or converts that same base-85 text encoding back into a BLOB. </p>
<p> The base85() function is not a standard part of SQLite. It must be loaded as a separate extension. The source code to base85() is in the <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/base85.c">base85.c source file</a> in the <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc">ext/misc/ folder</a> of the SQLite source tree. </p>
<p> The base85() function is not included in standard builds of the SQLite library, but it is loaded by default in the <a href="cli">CLI</a>. This is typical of the <a href="cli">CLI</a> which loads various extensions above and beyond what are available in the standard SQLite library. </p>
<p> Like <a href="base64">base64()</a> representations, the base85() function can be used to format binary content through any sane ASCII channel unmolested. It also plays nicely in CSV or written as TCL brace-enclosed literals or SQL string literals. It is not suited for unmodified use in XML-like documents. </p>
<h2 id="encoding">
<span>2. </span>Encoding</h2> <p> The encoding used resembles Ascii85, but was devised by the author (Larry Brasfield) before Mozilla, Adobe, ZMODEM or other Ascii85 variant sources existed, in the 1984 timeframe on a VAX mainframe. Further, this is an independent implementation of a base85 system. Hence, the author has rightfully put this into the public domain. </p>
<p> Base85 numerals are taken from the set of 7-bit USASCII codes, excluding control characters and Space ! " ' ( ) { | } ~ Del in code order representing digit values 0 to 84 (base 10.) </p>
<p> Groups of 4 bytes, interpreted as big-endian 32-bit values, are represented as 5-digit base85 numbers with MS to LS digit order. Groups of 1-3 bytes are represented with 2-4 digits, still big-endian but 8-24 bit values. (Using big-endian yields the simplest transition to byte groups smaller than 4 bytes. These byte groups can also be considered base-256 numbers.) Groups of 0 bytes are represented with 0 digits and vice-versa. No pad characters are used; encoded base85 numeral sequence (aka "group") length maps 1-to-1 to the decoded binary length. </p>
<p> Any character not in the base85 numeral set delimits groups. When base85 is streamed or stored in containers of indefinite size, newline is used to separate it into sub-sequences of no more than 80 digits so that fgets() can be used to read it. </p>
<h2 id="features">
<span>3. </span>Features</h2> <ol> <li><p> The base85() function always takes a single argument that must be TEXT (for base85-to-binary conversion) or a BLOB (for binary-to-base85 conversion). </p></li>
<li><p> If the argument to base85() is a BLOB, then the return value is TEXT according to the encoding described above. </p></li>
<li><p> If the argument to base85() is TEXT as described above then the return value is a BLOB that is the binary data corresponding to that base85 text. </p></li>
<li><p> An error is raised if the argument to base85() is something other than TEXT or BLOB. </p></li>
