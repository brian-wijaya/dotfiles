This is usually caused by the <a href="../classes/private_elements#returning_overriding_object">return override</a> trick.</p> </section>    <section class="content-section" aria-labelledby="message"> <h2 id="message" class="heading">Message</h2> <pre data-language="plain">TypeError: Cannot initialize #x twice on the same object (V8-based)

Private elements are installed on the value of <code>this</code> when the class constructor is called, so this error could happen if the <code>this</code> value is an already-constructed instance of this class.</p> <p>Usually, <code>this</code> in a constructor is a newly created object which doesn't have any preexisting properties. However, it can be overridden by the return value of the base class. If the base class returns another object, that object would replace the current object as the value of <code>this</code>:</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="js">class Base {
  constructor(o) {
    // This object will become the this value of any subclass
    return o;
  }
}

class Derived extends Base {
  #x = 0;
}
</pre></div> <p>If you call <code>new Derived(anyObject)</code>, where <code>anyObject</code> is not an instance of <code>Derived</code>, the <code>Derived</code> constructor will be called with <code>anyObject</code> as the <code>this</code> value, and therefore install the <code>#x</code> private field on <code>anyObject</code>. This is the "return override" trick, which allows you to define arbitrary information on unrelated objects. However, if you call <code>new Derived(new Derived())</code>, or call <code>new Derived(anyObject)</code> again, the <code>Derived</code> constructor will try to install the <code>#x</code> private field again on an object which already has the <code>#x</code> private field, causing this error.</p> </section><section class="content-section" aria-labelledby="see_also"> <h2 id="see_also" class="heading">See also</h2> <ul> <li><a href="../classes">Classes</a></li> <li><a href="../classes/private_elements">Private elements</a></li> </ul> </section><div class="_attribution">
