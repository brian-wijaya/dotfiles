<h1>PS/PDF</h1> <div class="lead">Adobe PostScript for Portable Document Format</div>  <p>Produces PostScript output with PDF notations.</p> <p>It is assumed the output will be directly converted into PDF format. The notations include PDF bounding box information, so that the resulting PDF file can be correctly used with pdf tools, such as <code>pdflatex</code>. In addition, if a node has a URL attribute, this gets translated into PDF code such that the node, when viewed in a PDF-viewer, e.g., <a href="https://get.adobe.com/reader/">Adobe Acrobat</a>, is a link to the given URL. If a URL is attached to the graph, this serves as a base, such that relative URLs on nodes are derived from it.</p><div class="_attribution">
