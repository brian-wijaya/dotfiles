<h1>overlap</h1> <div class="lead">Determines if and how node overlaps should be removed</div> <p> type: <i><a href="../../attr-types/string/index">string</a> | <a href="../../attr-types/bool/index">bool</a>, default: <code>true</code></i> </p> <p>Nodes are first enlarged using the <a href="../sep/index"><code>sep</code></a> attribute. If <code>true</code> , overlaps are retained. If the value is <code>"scale"</code>, overlaps are removed by uniformly scaling in x and y. If the value converts to <code>"false"</code>, and it is available, Prism, a proximity graph-based algorithm, is used to remove node overlaps. This can also be invoked explicitly with <code>overlap=prism</code>. This technique starts with a small scaling up, controlled by the <a href="../overlap_scaling/index"><code>overlap_scaling</code></a> attribute, which can remove a significant portion of the overlap. The prism option also accepts an optional non-negative integer suffix. This can be used to control the number of attempts made at overlap removal. By default, <code>overlap="prism"</code> is equivalent to <code>overlap="prism1000"</code>. Setting <code>overlap="prism0"</code> causes only the scaling phase to be run.</p> <p>If Prism is not available, or the version of Graphviz is earlier than 2.28, <code>"overlap=false"</code> uses a Voronoi-based technique. This can always be invoked explicitly with <code>"overlap=voronoi"</code>.</p> <p>If <code>overlap="scalexy"</code>, x and y are separately scaled to remove overlaps.</p> <p>If <code>overlap="compress"</code>, the layout will be scaled down as much as possible without introducing any overlaps, obviously assuming there are none to begin with.</p> <p><strong>N.B.</strong> The remaining allowed values of <code>overlap</code> correspond to algorithms which, at present, can produce bad aspect ratios. In addition, we deprecate the use of the <code>"ortho*"</code> and <code>"portho*"</code>.</p> <p>If the value is <code>"vpsc"</code>, overlap removal is done as a quadratic optimization to minimize node displacement while removing node overlaps.</p> <p>If the value is <code>"orthoxy"</code> or <code>"orthoyx"</code>, overlaps are moved by optimizing two constraint problems, one for the x axis and one for the y. The suffix indicates which axis is processed first. If the value is "ortho", the technique is similar to "orthoxy" except a heuristic is used to reduce the bias between the two passes. If the value is <code>"ortho_yx"</code>, the technique is the same as <code>"ortho"</code>, except the roles of x and y are reversed. The values <code>"portho"</code>, <code>"porthoxy"</code>, <code>"porthoxy"</code>, and <code>"portho_yx"</code> are similar to the previous four, except only pseudo-orthogonal ordering is enforced.</p> <p>If the layout is done by neato with <code><a href="../mode/index">mode</a>="ipsep"</code>, then one can use <code>overlap=ipsep</code>. In this case, the overlap removal constraints are incorporated into the layout algorithm itself. N.B. At present, this only supports one level of clustering.</p> <p>Except for <code>fdp</code> and <code>sfdp</code>, the layouts assume <code>overlap="true"</code> as the default. Fdp first uses a number of passes using a built-in, force-directed technique to try to remove overlaps. Thus, <code>fdp</code> accepts <code>overlap</code> with an integer prefix followed by a colon, specifying the number of tries. If there is no prefix, no initial tries will be performed. If there is nothing following a colon, none of the above methods will be attempted. By default, <code>fdp</code> uses <code>overlap="9:prism"</code>. Note that <code>overlap="true"</code>, <code>overlap="0:true"</code> and <code>overlap="0:"</code> all turn off all overlap removal.</p> <p>By default, <code>sfdp</code> uses <code>overlap="prism0"</code>.</p> <p>Except for the Voronoi and prism methods, all of these transforms preserve the orthogonal ordering of the original layout. That is, if the x coordinates of two nodes are originally the same, they will remain the same, and if the x coordinate of one node is originally less than the x coordinate of another, this relation will still hold in the transformed layout. The similar properties hold for the y coordinates. This is not quite true for the <code>"porth*"</code> cases. For these, orthogonal ordering is only preserved among nodes related by an edge.</p> <i>Valid on:</i> <ul><li>Graphs</li></ul>
