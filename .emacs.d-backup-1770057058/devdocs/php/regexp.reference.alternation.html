<h2 class="title">Alternation</h2> <p class="para"> Vertical bar characters are used to separate alternative patterns. For example, the pattern <code class="literal">gilbert|sullivan</code> matches either "gilbert" or "sullivan". Any number of alternatives may appear, and an empty alternative is permitted (matching the empty string). The matching process tries each alternative in turn, from left to right, and the first one that succeeds is used. If the alternatives are within a subpattern (defined below), "succeeds" means matching the rest of the main pattern as well as the alternative in the subpattern. </p> <p class="para"> It is possible to record which alternative was matched by using <code class="literal">(*MARK:NAME)</code> or <code class="literal">(*:NAME)</code>. Any number of such <code class="literal">(*MARK)</code> verbs may appear and their names do not have to be unique. When a match succeeds, the name of the last-encountered <code class="literal">(*MARK:NAME)</code> will be placed among matches as if it were a capture group called <code class="literal">MARK</code> so it can be read from the <code class="parameter">matches</code> of <span class="function"><a href="function.preg-match" class="function">preg_match()</a></span> and will be passed to the <code class="parameter">callback</code> of <span class="function"><a href="function.preg-replace-callback" class="function">preg_replace_callback()</a></span> etc. </p><div class="_attribution">
