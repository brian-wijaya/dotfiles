</h2> <p>Playwright tests can be run on any CI provider. This guide covers one way of running tests on GitHub using GitHub Actions.

</h2> <p>When <a href="index">installing Playwright</a> using the <a href="getting-started-vscode">VS Code extension</a> or with <code>npm init playwright@latest</code>, you are given the option to add a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Actions</a> workflow. This creates a <code>playwright.yml</code> file inside a <code>.github/workflows</code> folder containing everything you need so that your tests run on each push and pull request into the main/master branch. Here's how that file looks:</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v5
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v5
      with:
        node-version: lts/*
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Install Playwright Browsers
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
      with:
        name: playwright-report
        path: playwright-report/
        retention-days: 30</pre> <p>The workflow performs these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Clone your repository</li> <li>Install Node.js</li> <li>Install NPM Dependencies</li> <li>Install Playwright Browsers</li> <li>Run Playwright tests</li> <li>Upload HTML report to the GitHub UI</li> </ol> <p>To learn more about this, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Understanding GitHub Actions"</a>.</p> <h2 id="create-a-repo-and-push-to-github">Create a Repo and Push to GitHub<a href="#create-a-repo-and-push-to-github" aria-label="Direct link to Create a Repo and Push to GitHub" title="Direct link to Create a Repo and Push to GitHub">​</a>
</h2> <p>Once you have your <a href="#setting-up-github-actions">GitHub Actions workflow</a> setup, then all you need to do is <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create a repo on GitHub</a> or push your code to an existing repository.

</h3> <p>In the Artifacts section, click on the <strong>playwright-report</strong> to download your report in the format of a zip file.</p> <img width="972" alt="Downloading the HTML Report" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183437023-524f1803-84e4-4862-9ce3-1d55af0e023e.png"> <h3 id="viewing-the-html-report">Viewing the HTML Report<a href="#viewing-the-html-report" aria-label="Direct link to Viewing the HTML Report" title="Direct link to Viewing the HTML Report">​</a>
</h3> <p>Locally opening the report does not work as expected as you need a web server for everything to work correctly. First, extract the zip, preferably in a folder that already has Playwright installed. Using the command line, change into the directory where the report is and use <code>npx playwright show-report</code> followed by the name of the extracted folder. This serves up the report and enables you to view it in your browser.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright show-report name-of-my-extracted-playwright-report</pre> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/c5f60e56-fb75-4a2d-a4b6-054b8c5d69c1" alt="viewing the HTML report"></p> <p>To learn more about reports, check out our detailed guide on <a href="test-reporters#html-reporter">HTML Reporter</a></p> <h2 id="viewing-the-trace">Viewing the Trace<a href="#viewing-the-trace" aria-label="Direct link to Viewing the Trace" title="Direct link to Viewing the Trace">​</a>
</h2> <p>Once you have served the report using <code>npx playwright show-report</code>, click on the trace icon next to the test's file name as seen in the image above. You can then view the trace of your tests and inspect each action to try to find out why the tests are failing.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/10fe3585-8401-4051-b1c2-b2e92ac4c274" alt="playwright trace viewer"></p> <h2 id="publishing-report-on-the-web">Publishing report on the web<a href="#publishing-report-on-the-web" aria-label="Direct link to Publishing report on the web" title="Direct link to Publishing report on the web">​</a>

</h2> <p>Artifacts like trace files, HTML reports or even the console logs contain information about your test execution. They can contain sensitive data like user credentials for a test user, access tokens to a staging backend, testing source code, or sometimes even your application source code. Treat these files just as carefully as you treat that sensitive data. If you upload reports and traces as part of your CI workflow, make sure that you only upload them to trusted artifact stores, or that you encrypt the files before upload. The same is true for sharing artifacts with team members: Use a trusted file share or encrypt the files before sharing.</p> <h2 id="whats-next">What's Next<a href="#whats-next" aria-label="Direct link to What's Next" title="Direct link to What's Next">​</a>
