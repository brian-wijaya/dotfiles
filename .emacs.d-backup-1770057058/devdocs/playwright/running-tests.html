</h2> <p>With Playwright you can run a single test, a set of tests, or all tests. Tests can be run on one browser or multiple browsers using the <code>--project</code> flag. Tests run in parallel by default and in headless mode, meaning no browser window opens while running the tests and results appear in the terminal. You can run tests in headed mode using the <code>--headed</code> CLI argument, or run your tests in <a href="test-ui-mode">UI mode</a> using the <code>--ui</code> flag to see a full trace of your tests.</p> <p><strong>You will learn</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="running-tests#command-line">How to run tests from the command line</a></li> <li><a href="running-tests#debugging-tests">How to debug tests</a></li> <li><a href="running-tests#test-reports">How to open the HTML test reporter</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="running-tests">Running tests<a href="#running-tests" aria-label="Direct link to Running tests" title="Direct link to Running tests">​</a>

</h3> <p>You can run your tests with the <code>playwright test</code> command. This runs your tests on all browsers as configured in the <code>playwright.config</code> file, and results appear in the terminal. Tests run in headless mode by default, meaning no browser window opens while running the tests.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright test</pre> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="tests running in command line" src="https://playwright.dev/assets/images/run-tests-cli-6e7e3119a14239c9021b406d7109dc44.png" width="1724" height="658"></p> <h3 id="run-tests-in-ui-mode">Run tests in UI mode<a href="#run-tests-in-ui-mode" aria-label="Direct link to Run tests in UI mode" title="Direct link to Run tests in UI mode">​</a>

</h3> <p>To run your tests in headed mode, use the <code>--headed</code> flag. This gives you the ability to visually see how Playwright interacts with the website.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright test --headed</pre> <h3 id="run-tests-on-different-browsers">Run tests on different browsers<a href="#run-tests-on-different-browsers" aria-label="Direct link to Run tests on different browsers" title="Direct link to Run tests on different browsers">​</a>

Once installed you can simply click the green triangle next to the test you want to run or run all tests from the testing sidebar.

</h2> <p>Since Playwright runs in Node.js, you can debug it with your debugger of choice, e.g. using <code>console.log</code>, inside your IDE, or directly in VS Code with the <a href="getting-started-vscode">VS Code Extension</a>. Playwright comes with <a href="test-ui-mode">UI Mode</a>, where you can easily walk through each step of the test, see logs, errors, network requests, inspect the DOM snapshot, and more. You can also use the <a href="debug#playwright-inspector">Playwright Inspector</a>, which allows you to step through Playwright API calls, see their debug logs, and explore <a href="locators">locators</a>.</p> <h3 id="debug-tests-in-ui-mode">Debug tests in UI mode<a href="#debug-tests-in-ui-mode" aria-label="Direct link to Debug tests in UI mode" title="Direct link to Debug tests in UI mode">​</a>
</h3> <p>We highly recommend debugging your tests with <a href="test-ui-mode">UI Mode</a> for a better developer experience where you can easily walk through each step of the test and visually see what was happening before, during, and after each step.

You can also edit the locator in the locator playground and see it highlighting live in the browser window. Use the Copy Locator button to copy the locator to your clipboard and then paste it into your test.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="pick locator in ui mode" src="https://playwright.dev/assets/images/ui-mode-pick-locator-91b71dca4af49fdfad305a57b9d657b8.png" width="3598" height="2184"></p> <p>Check out our <a href="test-ui-mode">detailed guide on UI Mode</a> to learn more about its features.</p> <h3 id="debug-tests-with-the-playwright-inspector">Debug tests with the Playwright Inspector<a href="#debug-tests-with-the-playwright-inspector" aria-label="Direct link to Debug tests with the Playwright Inspector" title="Direct link to Debug tests with the Playwright Inspector">​</a>
</h3> <p>To debug all tests, run the Playwright test command followed by the <code>--debug</code> flag.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright test --debug</pre> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Debugging Tests with the Playwright inspector" src="https://playwright.dev/assets/images/run-tests-debug-04d9391d458299856c76dee6394874e0.png" width="2700" height="1736"></p> <p>This command opens a browser window as well as the Playwright Inspector. You can use the step over button at the top of the inspector to step through your test. Or, press the play button to run your test from start to finish. Once the test finishes, the browser window closes.</p> <p>To debug one test file, run the Playwright test command with the test file name that you want to debug followed by the <code>--debug</code> flag.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright test example.spec.ts --debug</pre> <p>To debug a specific test from the line number where the <code>test(..</code> is defined, add a colon followed by the line number at the end of the test file name, followed by the <code>--debug</code> flag.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright test example.spec.ts:10 --debug</pre> <p>While debugging you can use the Pick Locator button to select an element on the page and see the locator that Playwright would use to find that element.

</h2> <p>The <a href="test-reporters#html-reporter">HTML Reporter</a> shows you a full report of your tests allowing you to filter the report by browsers, passed tests, failed tests, skipped tests, and flaky tests. By default, the HTML report opens automatically if some tests failed, otherwise you can open it with the following command.</p> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript">npx playwright show-report</pre> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="HTML Report" src="https://playwright.dev/assets/images/html-report-951cba1d9da23ab59e46459fe2e73036.png" width="4032" height="2244"></p> <p>You can filter and search for tests as well as click on each test to see the test errors and explore each step of the test.</p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="HTML Reporter detail view" src="https://playwright.dev/assets/images/html-report-detail-2690519290492b327d5711d2eecddbb4.png" width="4032" height="2244"></p> <h2 id="whats-next">What's next<a href="#whats-next" aria-label="Direct link to What's next" title="Direct link to What's next">​</a>
