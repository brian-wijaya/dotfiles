   <h1 class="chapter">Redirection</h1>    <p>If a command is followed by <tt>&amp;</tt> and job control is not active, then the default standard input for the command is the empty file <tt>/dev/null</tt>. Otherwise, the environment for the execution of a command contains the file descriptors of the invoking shell as modified by input/output specifications. </p> <p>The following may appear anywhere in a simple command or may precede or follow a complex command. Expansion occurs before <var>word</var> or <var>digit</var> is used except as noted below.

<p>The shell input is read up to a line that is the same as <var>word</var>, or to an end-of-file. No parameter expansion, command substitution or filename generation is performed on <var>word</var>. The resulting document, called a <em>here-document</em>, becomes the standard input. </p> <p>If any character of <var>word</var> is quoted with single or double quotes or a ‘<tt>\</tt>’, no interpretation is placed upon the characters of the document. Otherwise, parameter and command substitution occurs, ‘<tt>\</tt>’ followed by a newline is removed, and ‘<tt>\</tt>’ must be used to quote the characters ‘<tt>\</tt>’, ‘<tt>$</tt>’, ‘<tt>‘</tt>’ and the first character of <var>word</var>. </p> <p>Note that <var>word</var> itself does not undergo shell expansion. Backquotes in <var>word</var> do not have their usual effect; instead they behave similarly to double quotes, except that the backquotes themselves are passed through unchanged. (This information is given for completeness and it is not recommended that backquotes be used.) Quotes in the form <tt>$’</tt><var>...</var><tt>’</tt> have their standard effect of expanding backslashed references to special characters. </p> <p>If <tt>&lt;&lt;-</tt> is used, then all leading tabs are stripped from <var>word</var> and from the document. </p> </dd> <dt>

The order in which redirections are specified is significant. The shell evaluates each redirection in terms of the (<em>file descriptor</em>, <em>file</em>) association at the time of evaluation. For example: </p> <blockquote> <p>... <tt>1&gt;</tt><var>fname</var> <tt>2&gt;&amp;1</tt> </p>
</blockquote> <p>first associates file descriptor 1 with file <var>fname</var>. It then associates file descriptor 2 with the file associated with file descriptor 1 (that is, <var>fname</var>). If the order of redirections were reversed, file descriptor 2 would be associated with the terminal (assuming file descriptor 1 had been) and then file descriptor 1 would be associated with file <var>fname</var>. </p> <p>The ‘<tt>|&amp;</tt>’ command separator described in <a href="shell-grammar#Simple-Commands-_0026-Pipelines">Simple Commands &amp; Pipelines</a> is a shorthand for ‘<tt>2&gt;&amp;1 |</tt>’. </p> <p>The various forms of process substitution, ‘<tt>&lt;(</tt><var>list</var><tt>)</tt>’, and ‘<tt>=(</tt><var>list</var><tt>)</tt>’ for input and ‘<tt>&gt;(</tt><var>list</var><tt>)</tt>’ for output, are often used together with redirection. For example, if <var>word</var> in an output redirection is of the form ‘<tt>&gt;(</tt><var>list</var><tt>)</tt>’ then the output is piped to the command represented by <var>list</var>. See <a href="expansion#Process-Substitution">Process Substitution</a>. </p>    <h2 class="section">Opening file descriptors using parameters</h2>   <p id="index-parameters_002c-for-using-file-descriptors">When the shell is parsing arguments to a command, and the shell option <tt>IGNORE_BRACES</tt> is not set, a different form of redirection is allowed: instead of a digit before the operator there is a valid shell identifier enclosed in braces. The shell will open a new file descriptor that is guaranteed to be at least 10 and set the parameter named by the identifier to the file descriptor opened. No whitespace is allowed between the closing brace and the redirection character. For example: </p> <blockquote> <p>... <tt>{myfd}&gt;&amp;1</tt> </p>
</blockquote> <p>This opens a new file descriptor that is a duplicate of file descriptor 1 and sets the parameter <tt>myfd</tt> to the number of the file descriptor, which will be at least 10. The new file descriptor can be written to using the syntax <tt>&gt;&amp;$myfd</tt>. The file descriptor remains open in subshells and forked external executables. </p> <p>The syntax <tt>{</tt><var>varid</var><tt>}&gt;&amp;-</tt>, for example <tt>{myfd}&gt;&amp;-</tt>, may be used to close a file descriptor opened in this fashion. Note that the parameter given by <var>varid</var> must previously be set to a file descriptor in this case. </p> <p>It is an error to open or close a file descriptor in this fashion when the parameter is readonly. However, it is not an error to read or write a file descriptor using <tt>&lt;&amp;$</tt><var>param</var> or <tt>&gt;&amp;$</tt><var>param</var> if <var>param</var> is readonly. </p> <p>If the option <tt>CLOBBER</tt> is unset, it is an error to open a file descriptor using a parameter that is already set to an open file descriptor previously allocated by this mechanism. Unsetting the parameter before using it for allocating a file descriptor avoids the error. </p> <p>Note that this mechanism merely allocates or closes a file descriptor; it does not perform any redirections from or to it. It is usually convenient to allocate a file descriptor prior to use as an argument to <tt>exec</tt>. The syntax does not in any case work when used around complex commands such as parenthesised subshells or loops, where the opening brace is interpreted as part of a command list to be executed in the current shell. </p> <p>The following shows a typical sequence of allocation, use, and closing of a file descriptor: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">integer myfd
exec {myfd}&gt;~/logs/mylogfile.txt
print This is a log message. &gt;&amp;$myfd
exec {myfd}&gt;&amp;-
</pre>
</div> <p>Note that the expansion of the variable in the expression <tt>&gt;&amp;$myfd</tt> occurs at the point the redirection is opened. This is after the expansion of command arguments and after any redirections to the left on the command line have been processed. </p>    <h2 class="section" id="Multios">Multios</h2>   <p id="index-MULTIOS_002c-use-of">If the user tries to open a file descriptor for writing more than once, the shell opens the file descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies its input to all the specified outputs, similar to <cite>tee</cite>, provided the <tt>MULTIOS</tt> option is set, as it is by default. Thus: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">date &gt;foo &gt;bar
</pre>
</div> <p>writes the date to two files, named ‘<tt>foo</tt>’ and ‘<tt>bar</tt>’. Note that a pipe is an implicit redirection; thus </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">date &gt;foo | cat
</pre>
</div> <p>writes the date to the file ‘<tt>foo</tt>’, and also pipes it to cat. </p> <p>Note that the shell opens all the files to be used in the multio process immediately, not at the point they are about to be written. </p> <p>Note also that redirections are always expanded in order. This happens regardless of the setting of the <tt>MULTIOS</tt> option, but with the option in effect there are additional consequences. For example, the meaning of the expression <tt>&gt;&amp;1</tt> will change after a previous redirection: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">date &gt;&amp;1 &gt;output
</pre>
</div> <p>In the case above, the <tt>&gt;&amp;1</tt> refers to the standard output at the start of the line; the result is similar to the <tt>tee</tt> command. However, consider: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">date &gt;output &gt;&amp;1
</pre>
</div> <p>As redirections are evaluated in order, when the <tt>&gt;&amp;1</tt> is encountered the standard output is set to the file <tt>output</tt> and another copy of the output is therefore sent to that file. This is unlikely to be what is intended. </p> <p>If the <tt>MULTIOS</tt> option is set, the word after a redirection operator is also subjected to filename generation (globbing). Thus </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">: &gt; *
</pre>
</div> <p>will truncate all files in the current directory, assuming there’s at least one. (Without the <tt>MULTIOS</tt> option, it would create an empty file called ‘<tt>*</tt>’.) Similarly, you can do </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">echo exit 0 &gt;&gt; *.sh
</pre>
</div> <p>If the user tries to open a file descriptor for reading more than once, the shell opens the file descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies all the specified inputs to its output in the order specified, provided the <tt>MULTIOS</tt> option is set. It should be noted that each file is opened immediately, not at the point where it is about to be read: this behaviour differs from <tt>cat</tt>, so if strictly standard behaviour is needed, <tt>cat</tt> should be used instead. </p> <p>Thus </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">sort &lt;foo &lt;fubar
</pre>
</div> <p>or even </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">sort &lt;f{oo,ubar}
</pre>
</div> <p>is equivalent to ‘<tt>cat foo fubar | sort</tt>’. </p> <p>Expansion of the redirection argument occurs at the point the redirection is opened, at the point described above for the expansion of the variable in <tt>&gt;&amp;$myfd</tt>. </p> <p>Note that a pipe is an implicit redirection; thus </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">cat bar | sort &lt;foo
</pre>
</div> <p>is equivalent to ‘<tt>cat bar foo | sort</tt>’ (note the order of the inputs). </p> <p>If the <tt>MULTIOS</tt> option is <em>un</em>set, each redirection replaces the previous redirection for that file descriptor. However, all files redirected to are actually opened, so </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">echo Hello &gt; bar &gt; baz
</pre>
</div> <p>when <tt>MULTIOS</tt> is unset will truncate ‘<tt>bar</tt>’, and write ‘<tt>Hello</tt>’ into ‘<tt>baz</tt>’. </p> <p>There is a problem when an output multio is attached to an external program. A simple example shows this: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">cat file &gt;file1 &gt;file2
cat file1 file2
</pre>
</div> <p>Here, it is possible that the second ‘<tt>cat</tt>’ will not display the full contents of <tt>file1</tt> and <tt>file2</tt> (i.e. the original contents of <tt>file</tt> repeated twice). </p> <p>The reason for this is that the multios are spawned after the <tt>cat</tt> process is forked from the parent shell, so the parent shell does not wait for the multios to finish writing data. This means the command as shown can exit before <tt>file1</tt> and <tt>file2</tt> are completely written. As a workaround, it is possible to run the <tt>cat</tt> process as part of a job in the current shell: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">{ cat file } &gt;file &gt;file2
</pre>
</div> <p>Here, the <tt>{</tt><var>...</var><tt>}</tt> job will pause to wait for both files to be written. </p>    <h2 class="section" id="Redirections-with-no-command">Redirections with no command</h2> <p>When a simple command consists of one or more redirection operators and zero or more parameter assignments, but no command name, zsh can behave in several ways. </p>   <p id="index-CSH_005fNULLCMD_002c-use-of">If the parameter <tt>NULLCMD</tt> is not set or the option <tt>CSH_NULLCMD</tt> is set, an error is caused.
