   <h1 class="chapter">Parameters</h1>      <h2 class="section">Description</h2> <p>A parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes. A name may be any sequence of alphanumeric characters and underscores, or the single characters ‘<tt>*</tt>’, ‘<tt>@</tt>’, ‘<tt>#</tt>’, ‘<tt>?</tt>’, ‘<tt>-</tt>’, ‘<tt>$</tt>’, or ‘<tt>!</tt>’. A parameter whose name begins with an alphanumeric or underscore is also referred to as a <em>variable</em>. </p>      <p id="index-hash">The attributes of a parameter determine the <em>type</em> of its value, often referred to as the parameter type or variable type, and also control other processing that may be applied to the value when it is referenced. The value type may be a <em>scalar</em> (a string, an integer, or a floating point number), an array (indexed numerically), or an <em>associative</em> array (an unordered set of name-value pairs, indexed by name, also referred to as a <em>hash</em>). </p>     <p id="index-variables_002c-environment">Named scalar parameters may have the <em>exported</em>, <tt>-x</tt>, attribute, to copy them into the process environment, which is then passed from the shell to any new processes that it starts. Exported parameters are called <em>environment variables</em>. The shell also <em>imports</em> environment variables at startup time and automatically marks the corresponding parameters as exported. Some environment variables are not imported for reasons of security or because they would interfere with the correct operation of other shell features. </p>   <p id="index-parameters_002c-special">Parameters may also be <em>special</em>, that is, they have a predetermined meaning to the shell. Special parameters cannot have their type changed or their readonly attribute turned off, and if a special parameter is unset, then later recreated, the special properties will be retained. </p> <p>To declare the type of a parameter, or to assign a string or numeric value to a scalar parameter, use the <tt>typeset</tt> builtin.  </p> <p>The value of a scalar parameter may also be assigned by writing:  </p> <blockquote> <p><var>name</var><tt>=</tt><var>value</var> </p>
</blockquote> <p>In scalar assignment, <var>value</var> is expanded as a single string, in which the elements of arrays are joined together; filename expansion is not performed unless the option <tt>GLOB_ASSIGN</tt> is set. </p> <p>When the integer attribute, <tt>-i</tt>, or a floating point attribute, <tt>-E</tt> or <tt>-F</tt>, is set for <var>name</var>, the <var>value</var> is subject to arithmetic evaluation. Furthermore, by replacing ‘<tt>=</tt>’ with ‘<tt>+=</tt>’, a parameter can be incremented or appended to. See <a href="#Array-Parameters">Array Parameters</a> and <a href="arithmetic-evaluation#Arithmetic-Evaluation">Arithmetic Evaluation</a> for additional forms of assignment. </p> <p>Note that assignment may implicitly change the attributes of a parameter. For example, assigning a number to a variable in arithmetic evaluation may change its type to integer or float, and with <tt>GLOB_ASSIGN</tt> assigning a pattern to a variable may change its type to an array. </p> <p>To reference the value of a parameter, write ‘<tt>$</tt><var>name</var>’ or ‘<tt>${</tt><var>name</var><tt>}</tt>’. See <a href="expansion#Parameter-Expansion">Parameter Expansion</a> for complete details. That section also explains the effect of the difference between scalar and array assignment on parameter expansion. </p>     <h2 class="section" id="Array-Parameters-1">Array Parameters</h2> <p>To assign an array value, write one of:   </p> <blockquote> <p><tt>set -A</tt> <var>name</var> <var>value</var> ... </p>
</blockquote> <blockquote> <p><var>name</var><tt>=(</tt><var>value</var> ...<tt>)</tt> </p>
</blockquote> <blockquote> <p><var>name</var><tt>=(</tt><tt>[</tt><var>key</var><tt>]=</tt><var>value</var> ...<tt>)</tt> </p>
</blockquote> <p>If no parameter <var>name</var> exists, an ordinary array parameter is created. If the parameter <var>name</var> exists and is a scalar, it is replaced by a new array. </p> <p>In the third form, <var>key</var> is an expression that will be evaluated in arithmetic context (in its simplest form, an integer) that gives the index of the element to be assigned with <var>value</var>. In this form any elements not explicitly mentioned that come before the largest index to which a value is assigned are assigned an empty string. The indices may be in any order. Note that this syntax is strict: <tt>[</tt> and <tt>]=</tt> must not be quoted, and <var>key</var> may not consist of the unquoted string <tt>]=</tt>, but is otherwise treated as a simple string. The enhanced forms of subscript expression that may be used when directly subscripting a variable name, described in the section ‘Array Subscripts’ below, are not available. </p> <p>The syntaxes with and without the explicit key may be mixed. An implicit <var>key</var> is deduced by incrementing the index from the previously assigned element. Note that it is not treated as an error if latter assignments in this form overwrite earlier assignments. </p> <p>For example, assuming the option <tt>KSH_ARRAYS</tt> is not set, the following: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">array=(one [3]=three four)
</pre>
</div> <p>causes the array variable <tt>array</tt> to contain four elements <tt>one</tt>, an empty string, <tt>three</tt> and <tt>four</tt>, in that order. </p> <p>In the forms where only <var>value</var> is specified, full command line expansion is performed. </p> <p>In the <tt>[</tt><var>key</var><tt>]=</tt><var>value</var> form, both <var>key</var> and <var>value</var> undergo all forms of expansion allowed for single word shell expansions (this does not include filename generation); these are as performed by the parameter expansion flag <tt>(e)</tt> as described in <a href="expansion#Parameter-Expansion">Parameter Expansion</a>. Nested parentheses may surround <var>value</var> and are included as part of the value, which is joined into a plain string; this differs from ksh which allows the values themselves to be arrays. A future version of zsh may support that. To cause the brackets to be interpreted as a character class for filename generation, and therefore to treat the resulting list of files as a set of values, quote the equal sign using any form of quoting. Example: </p> <blockquote> <p><var>name</var><tt>=(</tt><tt>[a-z]’=’*)</tt> </p>
</blockquote> <p>To append to an array without changing the existing values, use one of the following: </p> <blockquote> <p><var>name</var><tt>+=(</tt><var>value</var> ...<tt>)</tt> </p>
</blockquote> <blockquote> <p><var>name</var><tt>+=(</tt><tt>[</tt><var>key</var><tt>]=</tt><var>value</var> ...<tt>)</tt> </p>
</blockquote> <p>In the second form <var>key</var> may specify an existing index as well as an index off the end of the old array; any existing value is overwritten by <var>value</var>. Also, it is possible to use <tt>[</tt><var>key</var><tt>]+=</tt><var>value</var> to append to the existing value at that index. </p> <p>Within the parentheses on the right hand side of either form of the assignment, newlines and semicolons are treated the same as white space, separating individual <var>value</var>s. Any consecutive sequence of such characters has the same effect. </p> <p>Ordinary array parameters may also be explicitly declared with:  </p> <blockquote> <p><tt>typeset -a</tt> <var>name</var> </p>
</blockquote> <p>Associative arrays <em>must</em> be declared before assignment, by using: </p> <blockquote> <p><tt>typeset -A</tt> <var>name</var> </p>
</blockquote> <p>When <var>name</var> refers to an associative array, the list in an assignment is interpreted as alternating keys and values: </p> <blockquote> <p><tt>set -A</tt> <var>name</var> <var>key</var> <var>value</var> ... </p>
</blockquote> <blockquote> <p><var>name</var><tt>=(</tt><var>key</var> <var>value</var> ...<tt>)</tt> </p>
</blockquote> <blockquote> <p><var>name</var><tt>=(</tt><tt>[</tt><var>key</var><tt>]=</tt><var>value</var> ...<tt>)</tt> </p>
</blockquote> <p>Note that only one of the two syntaxes above may be used in any given assignment; the forms may not be mixed. This is unlike the case of numerically indexed arrays. </p> <p>Every <var>key</var> must have a <var>value</var> in this case. Note that this assigns to the entire array, deleting any elements that do not appear in the list. The append syntax may also be used with an associative array: </p> <blockquote> <p><var>name</var><tt>+=(</tt><var>key</var> <var>value</var> ...<tt>)</tt> </p>
</blockquote> <blockquote> <p><var>name</var><tt>+=(</tt><tt>[</tt><var>key</var><tt>]=</tt><var>value</var> ...<tt>)</tt> </p>
</blockquote> <p>This adds a new key/value pair if the key is not already present, and replaces the value for the existing key if it is. In the second form it is also possible to use <tt>[</tt><var>key</var><tt>]+=</tt><var>value</var> to append to the existing value at that key. Expansion is performed identically to the corresponding forms for normal arrays, as described above. </p> <p>To create an empty array (including associative arrays), use one of: </p> <blockquote> <p><tt>set -A</tt> <var>name</var> </p>
</blockquote> <blockquote> <p><var>name</var><tt>=()</tt> </p>
</blockquote>    <h3 class="subsection" id="Array-Subscripts">Array Subscripts</h3>  <p id="index-subscripts">Individual elements of an array may be selected using a subscript. A subscript of the form ‘<tt>[</tt><var>exp</var><tt>]</tt>’ selects the single element <var>exp</var>, where <var>exp</var> is an arithmetic expression which will be subject to arithmetic expansion as if it were surrounded by ‘<tt>$((</tt>...<tt>))</tt>’. The elements are numbered beginning with 1, unless the <tt>KSH_ARRAYS</tt> option is set in which case they are numbered from zero.  </p> <p>Subscripts may be used inside braces used to delimit a parameter name, thus ‘<tt>${foo[2]}</tt>’ is equivalent to ‘<tt>$foo[2]</tt>’. If the <tt>KSH_ARRAYS</tt> option is set, the braced form is the only one that works, as bracketed expressions otherwise are not treated as subscripts. </p> <p>If the <tt>KSH_ARRAYS</tt> option is not set, then by default accesses to an array element with a subscript that evaluates to zero return an empty string, while an attempt to write such an element is treated as an error. For backward compatibility the <tt>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</tt> option can be set to cause subscript values 0 and 1 to be equivalent; see the description of the option in <a href="options#Description-of-Options">Description of Options</a>. </p> <p>The same subscripting syntax is used for associative arrays, except that no arithmetic expansion is applied to <var>exp</var>. However, the parsing rules for arithmetic expressions still apply, which affects the way that certain special characters must be protected from interpretation. See <em>Subscript Parsing</em> below for details. </p> <p>A subscript of the form ‘<tt>[*]</tt>’ or ‘<tt>[@]</tt>’ evaluates to all elements of an array; there is no difference between the two except when they appear within double quotes. ‘<tt>"$foo[*]"</tt>’ evaluates to ‘<tt>"$foo[1] $foo[2] </tt>...<tt>"</tt>’, whereas ‘<tt>"$foo[@]"</tt>’ evaluates to ‘<tt>"$foo[1]" "$foo[2]" </tt>...’. For associative arrays, ‘<tt>[*]</tt>’ or ‘<tt>[@]</tt>’ evaluate to all the values, in no particular order. Note that this does not substitute the keys; see the documentation for the ‘<tt>k</tt>’ flag under <a href="expansion#Parameter-Expansion">Parameter Expansion</a> for complete details. When an array parameter is referenced as ‘<tt>$</tt><var>name</var>’ (with no subscript) it evaluates to ‘<tt>$</tt><var>name</var><tt>[*]</tt>’, unless the <tt>KSH_ARRAYS</tt> option is set in which case it evaluates to ‘<tt>${</tt><var>name</var><tt>[0]}</tt>’ (for an associative array, this means the value of the key ‘<tt>0</tt>’, which may not exist even if there are values for other keys). </p> <p>A subscript of the form ‘<tt>[</tt><var>exp1</var><tt>,</tt><var>exp2</var><tt>]</tt>’ selects all elements in the range <var>exp1</var> to <var>exp2</var>, inclusive. (Associative arrays are unordered, and so do not support ranges.) If one of the subscripts evaluates to a negative number, say <tt>-</tt><var>n</var>, then the <var>n</var>th element from the end of the array is used. Thus ‘<tt>$foo[-3]</tt>’ is the third element from the end of the array <tt>foo</tt>, and ‘<tt>$foo[1,-1]</tt>’ is the same as ‘<tt>$foo[*]</tt>’. </p> <p>Subscripting may also be performed on non-array values, in which case the subscripts specify a substring to be extracted. For example, if <tt>FOO</tt> is set to ‘<tt>foobar</tt>’, then ‘<tt>echo $FOO[2,5]</tt>’ prints ‘<tt>ooba</tt>’. Note that some forms of subscripting described below perform pattern matching, and in that case the substring extends from the start of the match of the first subscript to the end of the match of the second subscript. For example, </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">string="abcdefghijklm"
print ${string[(r)d?,(r)h?]}
</pre>
</div> <p>prints ‘<tt>defghi</tt>’. This is an obvious generalisation of the rule for single-character matches. For a single subscript, only a single character is referenced (not the range of characters covered by the match). </p> <p>Note that in substring operations the second subscript is handled differently by the <tt>r</tt> and <tt>R</tt> subscript flags: the former takes the shortest match as the length and the latter the longest match. Hence in the former case a <tt>*</tt> at the end is redundant while in the latter case it matches the whole remainder of the string. This does not affect the result of the single subscript case as here the length of the match is irrelevant. </p>    <h3 class="subsection" id="Array-Element-Assignment">Array Element Assignment</h3> <p>A subscript may be used on the left side of an assignment like so: </p> <blockquote> <p><var>name</var><tt>[</tt><var>exp</var><tt>]=</tt><var>value</var> </p>
</blockquote> <p>In this form of assignment the element or range specified by <var>exp</var> is replaced by the expression on the right side. An array (but not an associative array) may be created by assignment to a range or element. Arrays do not nest, so assigning a parenthesized list of values to an element or range changes the number of elements in the array, shifting the other elements to accommodate the new values. (This is not supported for associative arrays.) </p> <p>This syntax also works as an argument to the <tt>typeset</tt> command: </p> <blockquote> <p><tt>typeset</tt> <tt>"</tt><var>name</var><tt>[</tt><var>exp</var><tt>]"=</tt><var>value</var> </p>
</blockquote> <p>The <var>value</var> may <em>not</em> be a parenthesized list in this case; only single-element assignments may be made with <tt>typeset</tt>. Note that quotes are necessary in this case to prevent the brackets from being interpreted as filename generation operators. The <tt>noglob</tt> precommand modifier could be used instead. </p> <p>To delete an element of an ordinary array, assign ‘<tt>()</tt>’ to that element. To delete an element of an associative array, use the <tt>unset</tt> command: </p> <blockquote> <p><tt>unset</tt> <tt>"</tt><var>name</var><tt>[</tt><var>exp</var><tt>]"</tt> </p>
</blockquote>    <h3 class="subsection" id="Subscript-Flags">Subscript Flags</h3>  <p id="index-subscript-flags">If the opening bracket, or the comma in a range, in any subscript expression is directly followed by an opening parenthesis, the string up to the matching closing one is considered to be a list of flags, as in ‘<var>name</var><tt>[(</tt><var>flags</var><tt>)</tt><var>exp</var><tt>]</tt>’. </p> <p>The flags <tt>s</tt>, <tt>n</tt> and <tt>b</tt> take an argument; the delimiter is shown below as ‘<tt>:</tt>’, but any character, or the matching pairs ‘<tt>(</tt>...<tt>)</tt>’, ‘<tt>{</tt>...<tt>}</tt>’, ‘<tt>[</tt>...<tt>]</tt>’, or ‘<tt>&lt;</tt>...<tt>&gt;</tt>’, may be used, but note that ‘<tt>&lt;</tt>...<tt>&gt;</tt>’ can only be used if the subscript is inside a double quoted expression or a parameter substitution enclosed in braces as otherwise the expression is interpreted as a redirection. </p> <p>The flags currently understood are: </p> <dl compact> <dt><tt>w</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>If the parameter subscripted is a scalar then this flag makes subscripting work on words instead of characters. The default word separator is whitespace. When combined with the <tt>i</tt> or <tt>I</tt> flag, the effect is to produce the index of the first character of the first/last word which matches the given pattern; note that a failed match in this case always yields 0. </p> </dd> <dt>
<tt>s:</tt><var>string</var><tt>:</tt>
</dt> <dd>
<p>This gives the <var>string</var> that separates words (for use with the <tt>w</tt> flag). The delimiter character <tt>:</tt> is arbitrary; see above. </p> </dd> <dt><tt>p</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>Recognize the same escape sequences as the <tt>print</tt> builtin in the string argument of a subsequent ‘<tt>s</tt>’ flag. </p> </dd> <dt><tt>f</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>If the parameter subscripted is a scalar then this flag makes subscripting work on lines instead of characters, i.e. with elements separated by newlines. This is a shorthand for ‘<tt>pws:\n:</tt>’. </p> </dd> <dt><tt>r</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>Reverse subscripting: if this flag is given, the <var>exp</var> is taken as a pattern and the result is the first matching array element, substring or word (if the parameter is an array, if it is a scalar, or if it is a scalar and the ‘<tt>w</tt>’ flag is given, respectively). The subscript used is the number of the matching element, so that pairs of subscripts such as ‘<tt>$foo[(r)??,3]</tt>’ and ‘<tt>$foo[(r)??,(r)f*]</tt>’ are possible if the parameter is not an associative array. If the parameter is an associative array, only the value part of each pair is compared to the pattern, and the result is that value. </p> <p>If a search through an ordinary array failed, the search sets the subscript to one past the end of the array, and hence <tt>${array[(r)</tt><var>pattern</var><tt>]}</tt> will substitute the empty string. Thus the success of a search can be tested by using the <tt>(i)</tt> flag, for example (assuming the option <tt>KSH_ARRAYS</tt> is not in effect): </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">[[ ${array[(i)pattern]} -le ${#array} ]]
</pre>
</div> <p>If <tt>KSH_ARRAYS</tt> is in effect, the <tt>-le</tt> should be replaced by <tt>-lt</tt>. </p> </dd> <dt><tt>R</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>Like ‘<tt>r</tt>’, but gives the last match. For associative arrays, gives all possible matches. May be used for assigning to ordinary array elements, but not for assigning to associative arrays. On failure, for normal arrays this has the effect of returning the element corresponding to subscript 0; this is empty unless one of the options <tt>KSH_ARRAYS</tt> or <tt>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</tt> is in effect. </p> <p>Note that in subscripts with both ‘<tt>r</tt>’ and ‘<tt>R</tt>’ pattern characters are active even if they were substituted for a parameter (regardless of the setting of <tt>GLOB_SUBST</tt> which controls this feature in normal pattern matching). The flag ‘<tt>e</tt>’ can be added to inhibit pattern matching. As this flag does not inhibit other forms of substitution, care is still required; using a parameter to hold the key has the desired effect: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">key2='original key'
print ${array[(Re)$key2]}
</pre>
</div> </dd> <dt><tt>i</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>Like ‘<tt>r</tt>’, but gives the index of the match instead; this may not be combined with a second argument. On the left side of an assignment, behaves like ‘<tt>r</tt>’. For associative arrays, the key part of each pair is compared to the pattern, and the first matching key found is the result. On failure substitutes the length of the array plus one, as discussed under the description of ‘<tt>r</tt>’, or the empty string for an associative array. </p> <p>Note: Although ‘<tt>i</tt>’ may be applied to a scalar substitution to find the offset of a substring, the results are likely to be misleading when searching within substitutions that yield an empty string, or when searching for the empty substring. </p> </dd> <dt><tt>I</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>Like ‘<tt>i</tt>’, but gives the index of the last match, or all possible matching keys in an associative array. On failure substitutes 0, or the empty string for an associative array. This flag is best when testing for values or keys that do not exist. </p> <p>Note: If the option <tt>KSH_ARRAYS</tt> is in effect and no match is found, the result is indistinguishable from the case when the first element of the array matches. </p> </dd> <dt><tt>k</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>If used in a subscript on an associative array, this flag causes the keys to be interpreted as patterns, and returns the value for the first key found where <var>exp</var> is matched by the key. Note this could be any such key as no ordering of associative arrays is defined. This flag does not work on the left side of an assignment to an associative array element. If used on another type of parameter, this behaves like ‘<tt>r</tt>’. </p> </dd> <dt><tt>K</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>On an associative array this is like ‘<tt>k</tt>’ but returns all values where <var>exp</var> is matched by the keys. On other types of parameters this has the same effect as ‘<tt>R</tt>’. </p> </dd> <dt>
<tt>n:</tt><var>expr</var><tt>:</tt>
</dt> <dd>
<p>If combined with ‘<tt>r</tt>’, ‘<tt>R</tt>’, ‘<tt>i</tt>’ or ‘<tt>I</tt>’, makes them give the <var>n</var>th or <var>n</var>th last match (if <var>expr</var> evaluates to <var>n</var>). This flag is ignored when the array is associative. The delimiter character <tt>:</tt> is arbitrary; see above. </p> </dd> <dt>
<tt>b:</tt><var>expr</var><tt>:</tt>
</dt> <dd>
<p>If combined with ‘<tt>r</tt>’, ‘<tt>R</tt>’, ‘<tt>i</tt>’ or ‘<tt>I</tt>’, makes them begin at the <var>n</var>th or <var>n</var>th last element, word, or character (if <var>expr</var> evaluates to <var>n</var>). This flag is ignored when the array is associative. The delimiter character <tt>:</tt> is arbitrary; see above. </p> </dd> <dt><tt>e</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>This flag causes any pattern matching that would be performed on the subscript to use plain string matching instead. Hence ‘<tt>${array[(re)*]}</tt>’ matches only the array element whose value is <tt>*</tt>. Note that other forms of substitution such as parameter substitution are not inhibited. </p> <p>This flag can also be used to force <tt>*</tt> or <tt>@</tt> to be interpreted as a single key rather than as a reference to all values. It may be used for either purpose on the left side of an assignment. </p> </dd> </dl> <p>See <em>Parameter Expansion Flags</em> (<a href="expansion#Parameter-Expansion">Parameter Expansion</a>) for additional ways to manipulate the results of array subscripting. </p>    <h3 class="subsection" id="Subscript-Parsing">Subscript Parsing</h3> <p>This discussion applies mainly to associative array key strings and to patterns used for reverse subscripting (the ‘<tt>r</tt>’, ‘<tt>R</tt>’, ‘<tt>i</tt>’, etc. flags), but it may also affect parameter substitutions that appear as part of an arithmetic expression in an ordinary subscript. </p> <p>To avoid subscript parsing limitations in assignments to associative array elements, use the append syntax: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">aa+=('key with "*strange*" characters' 'value string')
</pre>
</div> <p>The basic rule to remember when writing a subscript expression is that all text between the opening ‘<tt>[</tt>’ and the closing ‘<tt>]</tt>’ is interpreted <em>as if</em> it were in double quotes (<a href="shell-grammar#Quoting">Quoting</a>). However, unlike double quotes which normally cannot nest, subscript expressions may appear inside double-quoted strings or inside other subscript expressions (or both!), so the rules have two important differences. </p> <p>The first difference is that brackets (‘<tt>[</tt>’ and ‘<tt>]</tt>’) must appear as balanced pairs in a subscript expression unless they are preceded by a backslash (‘<tt>\</tt>’). Therefore, within a subscript expression (and unlike true double-quoting) the sequence ‘<tt>\[</tt>’ becomes ‘<tt>[</tt>’, and similarly ‘<tt>\]</tt>’ becomes ‘<tt>]</tt>’. This applies even in cases where a backslash is not normally required; for example, the pattern ‘<tt>[^[]</tt>’ (to match any character other than an open bracket) should be written ‘<tt>[^\[]</tt>’ in a reverse-subscript pattern. However, note that ‘<tt>\[^\[\]</tt>’ and even ‘<tt>\[^[]</tt>’ mean the <em>same</em> thing, because backslashes are always stripped when they appear before brackets! </p> <p>The same rule applies to parentheses (‘<tt>(</tt>’ and ‘<tt>)</tt>’) and braces (‘<tt>{</tt>’ and ‘<tt>}</tt>’): they must appear either in balanced pairs or preceded by a backslash, and backslashes that protect parentheses or braces are removed during parsing. This is because parameter expansions may be surrounded by balanced braces, and subscript flags are introduced by balanced parentheses. </p> <p>The second difference is that a double-quote (‘<tt>"</tt>’) may appear as part of a subscript expression without being preceded by a backslash, and therefore that the two characters ‘<tt>\"</tt>’ remain as two characters in the subscript (in true double-quoting, ‘<tt>\"</tt>’ becomes ‘<tt>"</tt>’). However, because of the standard shell quoting rules, any double-quotes that appear must occur in balanced pairs unless preceded by a backslash. This makes it more difficult to write a subscript expression that contains an odd number of double-quote characters, but the reason for this difference is so that when a subscript expression appears inside true double-quotes, one can still write ‘<tt>\"</tt>’ (rather than ‘<tt>\\\"</tt>’) for ‘<tt>"</tt>’. </p> <p>To use an odd number of double quotes as a key in an assignment, use the <tt>typeset</tt> builtin and an enclosing pair of double quotes; to refer to the value of that key, again use double quotes: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">typeset -A aa
typeset "aa[one\"two\"three\"quotes]"=QQQ
print "$aa[one\"two\"three\"quotes]"
</pre>
</div> <p>It is important to note that the quoting rules do not change when a parameter expansion with a subscript is nested inside another subscript expression. That is, it is not necessary to use additional backslashes within the inner subscript expression; they are removed only once, from the innermost subscript outwards. Parameters are also expanded from the innermost subscript first, as each expansion is encountered left to right in the outer expression. </p> <p>A further complication arises from a way in which subscript parsing is <em>not</em> different from double quote parsing. As in true double-quoting, the sequences ‘<tt>\*</tt>’, and ‘<tt>\@</tt>’ remain as two characters when they appear in a subscript expression. To use a literal ‘<tt>*</tt>’ or ‘<tt>@</tt>’ as an associative array key, the ‘<tt>e</tt>’ flag must be used: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">typeset -A aa
aa[(e)*]=star
print $aa[(e)*]
</pre>
</div> <p>A last detail must be considered when reverse subscripting is performed. Parameters appearing in the subscript expression are first expanded and then the complete expression is interpreted as a pattern. This has two effects: first, parameters behave as if <tt>GLOB_SUBST</tt> were on (and it cannot be turned off); second, backslashes are interpreted twice, once when parsing the array subscript and again when parsing the pattern. In a reverse subscript, it’s necessary to use <em>four</em> backslashes to cause a single backslash to match literally in the pattern. For complex patterns, it is often easiest to assign the desired pattern to a parameter and then refer to that parameter in the subscript, because then the backslashes, brackets, parentheses, etc., are seen only when the complete expression is converted to a pattern. To match the value of a parameter literally in a reverse subscript, rather than as a pattern, use ‘<tt>${(q</tt><tt>)</tt><var>name</var><tt>}</tt>’ (<a href="expansion#Parameter-Expansion">Parameter Expansion</a>) to quote the expanded value. </p> <p>Note that the ‘<tt>k</tt>’ and ‘<tt>K</tt>’ flags are reverse subscripting for an ordinary array, but are <em>not</em> reverse subscripting for an associative array! (For an associative array, the keys in the array itself are interpreted as patterns by those flags; the subscript is a plain string in that case.) </p> <p>One final note, not directly related to subscripting: the numeric names of positional parameters (<a href="#Positional-Parameters">Positional Parameters</a>) are parsed specially, so for example ‘<tt>$2foo</tt>’ is equivalent to ‘<tt>${2}foo</tt>’. Therefore, to use subscript syntax to extract a substring from a positional parameter, the expansion must be surrounded by braces; for example, ‘<tt>${2[3,5]}</tt>’ evaluates to the third through fifth characters of the second positional parameter, but ‘<tt>$2[3,5]</tt>’ is the entire second parameter concatenated with the filename generation pattern ‘<tt>[3,5]</tt>’. </p>     <h2 class="section" id="Positional-Parameters-1">Positional Parameters</h2> <p>The positional parameters provide access to the command-line arguments of a shell function, shell script, or the shell itself; see <a href="invocation#Invocation">Invocation</a>, and also <a href="functions#Functions">Functions</a>. The parameter <var>n</var>, where <var>n</var> is a number, is the <var>n</var>th positional parameter. The parameter ‘<tt>$0</tt>’ is a special case, see <a href="#Parameters-Set-By-The-Shell">Parameters Set By The Shell</a>. </p> <p>The parameters <tt>*</tt>, <tt>@</tt> and <tt>argv</tt> are arrays containing all the positional parameters; thus ‘<tt>$argv[</tt><var>n</var><tt>]</tt>’, etc., is equivalent to simply ‘<tt>$</tt><var>n</var>’. Note that the options <tt>KSH_ARRAYS</tt> or <tt>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</tt> apply to these arrays as well, so with either of those options set, ‘<tt>${argv[0]}</tt>’ is equivalent to ‘<tt>$1</tt>’ and so on. </p> <p>Positional parameters may be changed after the shell or function starts by using the <tt>set</tt> builtin, by assigning to the <tt>argv</tt> array, or by direct assignment of the form ‘<var>n</var><tt>=</tt><var>value</var>’ where <var>n</var> is the number of the positional parameter to be changed. This also creates (with empty values) any of the positions from 1 to <var>n</var> that do not already have values. Note that, because the positional parameters form an array, an array assignment of the form ‘<var>n</var><tt>=(</tt><var>value</var> ...<tt>)</tt>’ is allowed, and has the effect of shifting all the values at positions greater than <var>n</var> by as many positions as necessary to accommodate the new values. </p>     <h2 class="section" id="Local-Parameters-1">Local Parameters</h2> <p>Shell function executions delimit scopes for shell parameters. (Parameters are dynamically scoped.) The <tt>typeset</tt> builtin, and its alternative forms <tt>declare</tt>, <tt>integer</tt>, <tt>local</tt> and <tt>readonly</tt> (but not <tt>export</tt>), can be used to declare a parameter as being local to the innermost scope. </p> <p>When a parameter is read or assigned to, the innermost existing parameter of that name is used. (That is, the local parameter hides any less-local parameter.) However, assigning to a non-existent parameter, or declaring a new parameter with <tt>export</tt>, causes it to be created in the <em>outer</em>most scope. </p> <p>Local parameters disappear when their scope ends. <tt>unset</tt> can be used to delete a parameter while it is still in scope; any outer parameter of the same name remains hidden. </p> <p>Special parameters may also be made local; they retain their special attributes unless either the existing or the newly-created parameter has the <tt>-h</tt> (hide) attribute. This may have unexpected effects: there is no default value, so if there is no assignment at the point the variable is made local, it will be set to an empty value (or zero in the case of integers). The following: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">typeset PATH=/new/directory:$PATH
</pre>
</div> <p>is valid for temporarily allowing the shell or programmes called from it to find the programs in <tt>/new/directory</tt> inside a function. </p> <p>Note that the restriction in older versions of zsh that local parameters were never exported has been removed. </p>     <h2 class="section" id="Parameters-Set-By-The-Shell-1">Parameters Set By The Shell</h2> <p>In the parameter lists that follow, the mark ‘&lt;S&gt;’ indicates that the parameter is special. ‘&lt;Z&gt;’ indicates that the parameter does not exist when the shell initializes in <tt>sh</tt> or <tt>ksh</tt> emulation mode. </p> <p>The parameters ‘<tt>!</tt>’, ‘<tt>#</tt>’, ‘<tt>*</tt>’, ‘<tt>-</tt>’, ‘<tt>?</tt>’, ‘<tt>@</tt>’, ‘<tt>$</tt>’, ‘<tt>ARGC</tt>’, ‘<tt>HISTCMD</tt>’, ‘<tt>LINENO</tt>’, ‘<tt>PPID</tt>’, ‘<tt>status</tt>’, ‘<tt>TTYIDLE</tt>’, ‘<tt>zsh_eval_context</tt>’, ‘<tt>ZSH_EVAL_CONTEXT</tt>’, and ‘<tt>ZSH_SUBSHELL</tt>’ are read-only and thus cannot be restored by the user, so they are not output by ‘<tt>typeset -p</tt>’.

<p>This variable determines the locale category for character handling functions. If the <tt>MULTIBYTE</tt> option is in effect this variable or <tt>LANG</tt> should contain a value that reflects the character set in use, even if it is a single-byte character set, unless only the 7-bit subset (ASCII) is used.

If the command is suspended and continued later with the <tt>fg</tt> or <tt>wait</tt> builtins it will see the modes specified by <tt>STTY</tt>, as if it were not suspended. This (intentionally) does not apply if the command is continued via ‘<tt>kill -CONT</tt>’. <tt>STTY</tt> is ignored if the command is run in the background, or if it is in the environment of the shell but not explicitly assigned to in the input line. This avoids running stty at every external command by accidentally exporting it. Also note that <tt>STTY</tt> should not be used for window size specifications; these will not be local to the command. </p> <p>If the parameter is set and empty, all of the above applies except that <tt>stty</tt> is not run.

If there is a trap on <tt>SIGALRM</tt>, it will be executed and a new alarm is scheduled using the value of the <tt>TMOUT</tt> parameter after executing the trap. If no trap is set, and the idle time of the terminal is not less than the value of the <tt>TMOUT</tt> parameter, zsh terminates. Otherwise a new alarm is scheduled to <tt>TMOUT</tt> seconds after the last keypress. </p>  </dd> <dt id="index-SAVEHIST"><tt>TMPPREFIX</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>A pathname prefix which the shell will use for all temporary files. Note that this should include an initial part for the file name as well as any directory names. The default is ‘<tt>/tmp/zsh</tt>’. </p>  </dd> <dt id="index-SPROMPT"><tt>TMPSUFFIX</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>A filename suffix which the shell will use for temporary files created by process substitutions (e.g., ‘<tt>=(<var>list</var>)</tt>’). Note that the value should include a leading dot ‘<tt>.</tt>’ if intended to be interpreted as a file extension. The default is not to append any suffix, thus this parameter should be assigned only when needed and then unset again. </p>  </dd> <dt id="index-STTY">
<tt>WORDCHARS</tt> &lt;S&gt;</dt> <dd>
<p>A list of non-alphanumeric characters considered part of a word by the line editor. </p>  </dd> <dt id="index-TERM"><tt>ZBEEP</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>If set, this gives a string of characters, which can use all the same codes as the <tt>bindkey</tt> command as described in <a href="zsh-modules#The-zsh_002fzle-Module">The zsh/zle Module</a>, that will be output to the terminal instead of beeping. This may have a visible instead of an audible effect; for example, the string ‘<tt>\e[?5h\e[?5l</tt>’ on a vt100 or xterm will have the effect of flashing reverse video on and off (if you usually use reverse video, you should use the string ‘<tt>\e[?5l\e[?5h</tt>’ instead). This takes precedence over the <tt>NOBEEP</tt> option. </p>  </dd> <dt id="index-TERMINFO"><tt>ZDOTDIR</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>The directory to search for shell startup files (.zshrc, etc), if not <tt>$HOME</tt>. </p>    </dd> <dt id="index-TERMINFO_005fDIRS"><tt>zle_bracketed_paste</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>Many terminal emulators have a feature that allows applications to identify when text is pasted into the terminal rather than being typed normally. For ZLE, this means that special characters such as tabs and newlines can be inserted instead of invoking editor commands. Furthermore, pasted text forms a single undo event and if the region is active, pasted text will replace the region. </p> <p>This two-element array contains the terminal escape sequences for enabling and disabling the feature. These escape sequences are used to enable bracketed paste when ZLE is active and disable it at other times. Unsetting the parameter has the effect of ensuring that bracketed paste remains disabled. </p>  </dd> <dt id="index-TIMEFMT"><tt>zle_highlight</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>An array describing contexts in which ZLE should highlight the input text. See <a href="zsh-line-editor#Character-Highlighting">Character Highlighting</a>. </p>  </dd> <dt id="index-TMOUT"><tt>ZLE_LINE_ABORTED</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>This parameter is set by the line editor when an error occurs. It contains the line that was being edited at the point of the error. ‘<tt>print -zr – $ZLE_LINE_ABORTED</tt>’ can be used to recover the line. Only the most recent line of this kind is remembered. </p>   </dd> <dt id="index-TMPPREFIX"><tt>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</tt></dt> <dt id="index-TMPSUFFIX"><tt>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>These parameters are used by the line editor. In certain circumstances suffixes (typically space or slash) added by the completion system will be removed automatically, either because the next editing command was not an insertable character, or because the character was marked as requiring the suffix to be removed. </p> <p>These variables can contain the sets of characters that will cause the suffix to be removed. If <tt>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</tt> is set, those characters will cause the suffix to be removed; if <tt>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</tt> is set, those characters will cause the suffix to be removed and replaced by a space. </p> <p>If <tt>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</tt> is not set, the default behaviour is equivalent to: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS=$' \t\n;&amp;|'
</pre>
</div> <p>If <tt>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</tt> is set but is empty, no characters have this behaviour. <tt>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</tt> takes precedence, so that the following: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS=$'&amp;|'
</pre>
</div> <p>causes the characters ‘<tt>&amp;</tt>’ and ‘<tt>|</tt>’ to remove the suffix but to replace it with a space. </p> <p>To illustrate the difference, suppose that the option <tt>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH</tt> is in effect and the directory <tt>DIR</tt> has just been completed, with an appended <tt>/</tt>, following which the user types ‘<tt>&amp;</tt>’. The default result is ‘<tt>DIR&amp;</tt>’. With <tt>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</tt> set but without including ‘<tt>&amp;</tt>’ the result is ‘<tt>DIR/&amp;</tt>’. With <tt>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</tt> set to include ‘<tt>&amp;</tt>’ the result is ‘<tt>DIR &amp;</tt>’. </p> <p>Note that certain completions may provide their own suffix removal or replacement behaviour which overrides the values described here. See the completion system documentation in <a href="completion-system#Completion-System">Completion System</a>. </p>  </dd> <dt id="index-WORDCHARS">
<tt>ZLE_RPROMPT_INDENT</tt> &lt;S&gt;</dt> <dd>
<p>If set, used to give the indentation between the right hand side of the right prompt in the line editor as given by <tt>RPS1</tt> or <tt>RPROMPT</tt> and the right hand side of the screen. If not set, the value 1 is used. </p> <p>Typically this will be used to set the value to 0 so that the prompt appears flush with the right hand side of the screen. This is not the default as many terminals do not handle this correctly, in particular when the prompt appears at the extreme bottom right of the screen. Recent virtual terminals are more likely to handle this case correctly. Some experimentation is necessary. </p> </dd> </dl>   <p> <font size="-1"> This document was generated on <i>May 14, 2022</i> using <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/texi2html/"><i>texi2html 5.0</i></a>. </font> <br> <font size="-1">Zsh version 5.9, released on May 14, 2022.</font> </p><div class="_attribution">
