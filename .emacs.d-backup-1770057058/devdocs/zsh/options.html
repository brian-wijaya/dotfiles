   <h1 class="chapter">Options</h1>       <h2 class="section">Specifying Options</h2>  <p id="index-options_002c-specifying">Options are primarily referred to by name. These names are case insensitive and underscores are ignored. For example, ‘<tt>allexport</tt>’ is equivalent to ‘<tt>A__lleXP_ort</tt>’. </p> <p>The sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding it with ‘<tt>no</tt>’, so ‘<tt>setopt No_Beep</tt>’ is equivalent to ‘<tt>unsetopt beep</tt>’. This inversion can only be done once, so ‘<tt>nonobeep</tt>’ is <em>not</em> a synonym for ‘<tt>beep</tt>’. Similarly, ‘<tt>tify</tt>’ is not a synonym for ‘<tt>nonotify</tt>’ (the inversion of ‘<tt>notify</tt>’). </p> <p>Some options also have one or more single letter names. There are two sets of single letter options: one used by default, and another used to emulate <cite>sh</cite>/<cite>ksh</cite> (used when the <tt>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</tt> option is set). The single letter options can be used on the shell command line, or with the <tt>set</tt>, <tt>setopt</tt> and <tt>unsetopt</tt> builtins, as normal Unix options preceded by ‘<tt>-</tt>’. </p> <p>The sense of the single letter options may be inverted by using ‘<tt>+</tt>’ instead of ‘<tt>-</tt>’. Some of the single letter option names refer to an option being off, in which case the inversion of that name refers to the option being on. For example, ‘<tt>+n</tt>’ is the short name of ‘<tt>exec</tt>’, and ‘<tt>-n</tt>’ is the short name of its inversion, ‘<tt>noexec</tt>’. </p> <p>In strings of single letter options supplied to the shell at startup, trailing whitespace will be ignored; for example the string ‘<tt>-f </tt>’ will be treated just as ‘<tt>-f</tt>’, but the string ‘<tt>-f i</tt>’ is an error. This is because many systems which implement the ‘<tt>#!</tt>’ mechanism for calling scripts do not strip trailing whitespace. </p> <p>It is possible for options to be set within a function scope. See the description of the option <tt>LOCAL_OPTIONS</tt> below. </p>     <h2 class="section" id="Description-of-Options-1">Description of Options</h2>  <p id="index-options_002c-description">In the following list, options set by default in all emulations are marked &lt;D&gt;; those set by default only in csh, ksh, sh, or zsh emulations are marked &lt;C&gt;, &lt;K&gt;, &lt;S&gt;, &lt;Z&gt; as appropriate.

<p>By default, shell history that is read in from files is split into words on all white space.

<p>This option is a variant of <tt>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</tt> in which, where possible, the history entry is written out to the file after the command is finished, so that the time taken by the command is recorded correctly in the history file in <tt>EXTENDED_HISTORY</tt> format. This means that the history entry will not be available immediately from other instances of the shell that are using the same history file. </p> <p>This option is only useful if <tt>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</tt> and <tt>SHARE_HISTORY</tt> are turned off.

<p>When this option is set the <tt>command</tt> builtin can be used to execute shell builtin commands. Parameter assignments specified before shell functions and special builtins are kept after the command completes unless the special builtin is prefixed with the <tt>command</tt> builtin. Special builtins are <tt>.</tt>, <tt>:</tt>, <tt>break</tt>, <tt>continue</tt>, <tt>declare</tt>, <tt>eval</tt>, <tt>exit</tt>, <tt>export</tt>, <tt>integer</tt>, <tt>local</tt>, <tt>readonly</tt>, <tt>return</tt>, <tt>set</tt>, <tt>shift</tt>, <tt>source</tt>, <tt>times</tt>, <tt>trap</tt> and <tt>unset</tt>. </p> <p>In addition, various error conditions associated with the above builtins or <tt>exec</tt> cause a non-interactive shell to exit and an interactive shell to return to its top-level processing. </p> <p>Furthermore, functions and shell builtins are not executed after an <tt>exec</tt> prefix; the command to be executed must be an external command found in the path. </p> <p>Furthermore, the <tt>getopts</tt> builtin behaves in a POSIX-compatible fashion in that the associated variable <tt>OPTIND</tt> is not made local to functions, and its value is calculated differently to match other shells. </p> <p>Moreover, the warning and special exit code from <tt>[[ -o </tt><var>non_existent_option</var><tt> ]]</tt> are suppressed. </p>       </dd> <dt id="index-NOBSDECHO">
<tt>POSIX_IDENTIFIERS</tt> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;</dt> <dd>
<p>When this option is set, only the ASCII characters <tt>a</tt> to <tt>z</tt>, <tt>A</tt> to <tt>Z</tt>, <tt>0</tt> to <tt>9</tt> and <tt>_</tt> may be used in identifiers (names of shell parameters and modules). </p> <p>In addition, setting this option limits the effect of parameter substitution with no braces, so that the expression <tt>$#</tt> is treated as the parameter <tt>$#</tt> even if followed by a valid parameter name. When it is unset, zsh allows expressions of the form <tt>$#</tt><var>name</var> to refer to the length of <tt>$</tt><var>name</var>, even for special variables, for example in expressions such as <tt>$#-</tt> and <tt>$#*</tt>. </p> <p>Another difference is that with the option set assignment to an unset variable in arithmetic context causes the variable to be created as a scalar rather than a numeric type. So after ‘<tt>unset t; (( t = 3 ))</tt>’. without <tt>POSIX_IDENTIFIERS</tt> set <tt>t</tt> has integer type, while with it set it has scalar type. </p> <p>When the option is unset and multibyte character support is enabled (i.e. it is compiled in and the option <tt>MULTIBYTE</tt> is set), then additionally any alphanumeric characters in the local character set may be used in identifiers. Note that scripts and functions written with this feature are not portable, and also that both options must be set before the script or function is parsed; setting them during execution is not sufficient as the syntax <var>variable</var><tt>=</tt><var>value</var> has already been parsed as a command rather than an assignment. </p> <p>If multibyte character support is not compiled into the shell this option is ignored; all octets with the top bit set may be used in identifiers. This is non-standard but is the traditional zsh behaviour. </p>        </dd> <dt id="index-echo_002c-BSD-compatible">
<tt>POSIX_STRINGS</tt> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;</dt> <dd>
<p>This option affects processing of quoted strings. Currently it only affects the behaviour of null characters, i.e. character 0 in the portable character set corresponding to US ASCII. </p> <p>When this option is not set, null characters embedded within strings of the form <tt>$’</tt><var>...</var><tt>’</tt> are treated as ordinary characters. The entire string is maintained within the shell and output to files where necessary, although owing to restrictions of the library interface the string is truncated at the null character in file names, environment variables, or in arguments to external programs. </p> <p>When this option is set, the <tt>$’</tt><var>...</var><tt>’</tt> expression is truncated at the null character. Note that remaining parts of the same string beyond the termination of the quotes are not truncated. </p> <p>For example, the command line argument <tt>a$’b\0c’d</tt> is treated with the option off as the characters <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, null, <tt>c</tt>, <tt>d</tt>, and with the option on as the characters <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, <tt>d</tt>. </p>       </dd> <dt id="index-CONTINUE_005fON_005fERROR">

<p>When this option is set, the usual zsh behaviour of executing traps for <tt>EXIT</tt> on exit from shell functions is suppressed. In that case, manipulating <tt>EXIT</tt> traps always alters the global trap for exiting the shell; the <tt>LOCAL_TRAPS</tt> option is ignored for the <tt>EXIT</tt> trap. </p> <p>Also, a <tt>return</tt> statement executed in a trap with no argument passes back from the function the value from the surrounding context, not from code executed within the trap. </p> <p>Furthermore, if a trap is set to be ignored, this state persists when a subshell is entered.
