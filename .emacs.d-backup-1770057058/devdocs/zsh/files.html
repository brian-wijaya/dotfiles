   <h1 class="chapter">Files</h1>    <h2 class="section">Startup/Shutdown Files</h2>           <p id="index-zshenv">Commands are first read from <tt>/etc/zshenv</tt>; this cannot be overridden. Subsequent behaviour is modified by the <tt>RCS</tt> and <tt>GLOBAL_RCS</tt> options; the former affects all startup files, while the second only affects global startup files (those shown here with an path starting with a <tt>/</tt>). If one of the options is unset at any point, any subsequent startup file(s) of the corresponding type will not be read. It is also possible for a file in <tt>$ZDOTDIR</tt> to re-enable <tt>GLOBAL_RCS</tt>. Both <tt>RCS</tt> and <tt>GLOBAL_RCS</tt> are set by default. </p> <p>Commands are then read from <tt>$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv</tt>.   If the shell is a login shell, commands are read from <tt>/etc/zprofile</tt> and then <tt>$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile</tt>.  Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are read from <tt>/etc/zshrc</tt> and then <tt>$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc</tt>.  Finally, if the shell is a login shell, <tt>/etc/zlogin</tt> and <tt>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin</tt> are read. </p>  <p id="index-zlogout">When a login shell exits, the files <tt>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout</tt> and then <tt>/etc/zlogout</tt> are read. This happens with either an explicit exit via the <tt>exit</tt> or <tt>logout</tt> commands, or an implicit exit by reading end-of-file from the terminal. However, if the shell terminates due to <tt>exec</tt>’ing another process, the logout files are not read. These are also affected by the <tt>RCS</tt> and <tt>GLOBAL_RCS</tt> options. Note also that the <tt>RCS</tt> option affects the saving of history files, i.e. if <tt>RCS</tt> is unset when the shell exits, no history file will be saved. </p>  <p id="index-HOME_002c-use-of">If <tt>ZDOTDIR</tt> is unset, <tt>HOME</tt> is used instead. Files listed above as being in <tt>/etc</tt> may be in another directory, depending on the installation. </p> <p>As <tt>/etc/zshenv</tt> is run for all instances of zsh, it is important that it be kept as small as possible. In particular, it is a good idea to put code that does not need to be run for every single shell behind a test of the form ‘<tt>if [[ -o rcs ]]; then ...</tt>’ so that it will not be executed when zsh is invoked with the ‘<tt>-f</tt>’ option. </p>    <h2 class="section" id="Files-1">Files</h2>  <dl compact id="index-files-used"> <dt><tt>$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv</tt></dt> <dt><tt>$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile</tt></dt> <dt><tt>$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc</tt></dt> <dt><tt>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin</tt></dt> <dt><tt>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout</tt></dt> <dt>
