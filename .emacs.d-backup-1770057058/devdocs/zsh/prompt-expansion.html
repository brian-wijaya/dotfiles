<p>The status of the parser, i.e. the shell constructs (like ‘<tt>if</tt>’ and ‘<tt>for</tt>’) that have been started on the command line. If given an integer number that many strings will be printed; zero or negative or no integer means print as many as there are.

<p>Current working directory. If an integer follows the ‘<tt>%</tt>’, it specifies a number of trailing components of the current working directory to show; zero means the whole path.

</dt> <dd>
<p><var>string</var> is formatted using the <tt>strftime</tt> function. See strftime(3) for more details. Various zsh extensions provide numbers with no leading zero or space if the number is a single digit: </p> <dl compact> <dt><tt>%f</tt></dt> <dd><p>a day of the month </p></dd> <dt><tt>%K</tt></dt> <dd><p>the hour of the day on the 24-hour clock </p></dd> <dt><tt>%L</tt></dt> <dd><p>the hour of the day on the 12-hour clock </p></dd> </dl> <p>In addition, if the system supports the POSIX <tt>gettimeofday</tt> system call, <tt>%.</tt> provides decimal fractions of a second since the epoch with leading zeroes. By default three decimal places are provided, but a number of digits up to 9 may be given following the <tt>%</tt>; hence <tt>%6.</tt> outputs microseconds, and <tt>%9.</tt> outputs nanoseconds. (The latter requires a nanosecond-precision <tt>clock_gettime</tt>; systems lacking this will return a value multiplied by the appropriate power of 10.) A typical example of this is the format ‘<tt>%D{%H:%M:%S.%.}</tt>’. </p> <p>The GNU extension <tt>%N</tt> is handled as a synonym for <tt>%9.</tt>. </p> <p>Additionally, the GNU extension that a ‘<tt>-</tt>’ between the <tt>%</tt> and the format character causes a leading zero or space to be stripped is handled directly by the shell for the format characters <tt>d</tt>, <tt>f</tt>, <tt>H</tt>, <tt>k</tt>, <tt>l</tt>, <tt>m</tt>, <tt>M</tt>, <tt>S</tt> and <tt>y</tt>; any other format characters are provided to the system’s strftime(3) with any leading ‘<tt>-</tt>’ present, so the handling is system dependent. Further GNU (or other) extensions are also passed to strftime(3) and may work if the system supports them. </p> </dd> </dl>    <h3 class="subsection" id="Visual-effects">Visual effects</h3> <dl compact> <dt>

In the latter case the values allowed are as described for the <tt>fg</tt> <tt>zle_highlight</tt> attribute; <a href="zsh-line-editor#Character-Highlighting">Character Highlighting</a>.

<p>Within a <tt>%{</tt>...<tt>%}</tt> sequence, include a ‘glitch’: that is, assume that a single character width will be output. This is useful when outputting characters that otherwise cannot be correctly handled by the shell, such as the alternate character set on some terminals. The characters in question can be included within a <tt>%{</tt>...<tt>%}</tt> sequence together with the appropriate number of <tt>%G</tt> sequences to indicate the correct width. An integer between the ‘<tt>%</tt>’ and ‘<tt>G</tt>’ indicates a character width other than one. Hence <tt>%{</tt><var>seq</var><tt>%2G%}</tt> outputs <var>seq</var> and assumes it takes up the width of two standard characters. </p> <p>Multiple uses of <tt>%G</tt> accumulate in the obvious fashion; the position of the <tt>%G</tt> is unimportant. Negative integers are not handled. </p> <p>Note that when prompt truncation is in use it is advisable to divide up output into single characters within each <tt>%{</tt>...<tt>%}</tt> group so that the correct truncation point can be found. </p> </dd> </dl>    <h2 class="section" id="Conditional-Substrings-in-Prompts">Conditional Substrings in Prompts</h2> <dl compact> <dt id="index-psvar_002c-use-of"><tt>%v</tt></dt> <dd>

A ‘<tt>)</tt>’ may appear in the <var>false-text</var> as ‘<tt>%)</tt>’. <var>true-text</var> and <var>false-text</var> may both contain arbitrarily-nested escape sequences, including further ternary expressions. </p> <p>The left parenthesis may be preceded or followed by a positive integer <var>n</var>, which defaults to zero.

<tt>%[</tt><var>xstring</var><tt>]</tt>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Specifies truncation behaviour for the remainder of the prompt string. The third, deprecated, form is equivalent to ‘<tt>%</tt><var>xstringx</var>’, i.e. <var>x</var> may be ‘<tt>&lt;</tt>’ or ‘<tt>&gt;</tt>’. The <var>string</var> will be displayed in place of the truncated portion of any string; note this does not undergo prompt expansion. </p> <p>The numeric argument, which in the third form may appear immediately after the ‘<tt>[</tt>’, specifies the maximum permitted length of the various strings that can be displayed in the prompt. In the first two forms, this numeric argument may be negative, in which case the truncation length is determined by subtracting the absolute value of the numeric argument from the number of character positions remaining on the current prompt line. If this results in a zero or negative length, a length of 1 is used. In other words, a negative argument arranges that after truncation at least <var>n</var> characters remain before the right margin (left margin for <tt>RPROMPT</tt>). </p> <p>The forms with ‘<tt>&lt;</tt>’ truncate at the left of the string, and the forms with ‘<tt>&gt;</tt>’ truncate at the right of the string. For example, if the current directory is ‘<tt>/home/pike</tt>’, the prompt ‘<tt>%8&lt;..&lt;%/</tt>’ will expand to ‘<tt>..e/pike</tt>’. In this string, the terminating character (‘<tt>&lt;</tt>’, ‘<tt>&gt;</tt>’ or ‘<tt>]</tt>’), or in fact any character, may be quoted by a preceding ‘<tt>\</tt>’; note when using <tt>print -P</tt>, however, that this must be doubled as the string is also subject to standard <tt>print</tt> processing, in addition to any backslashes removed by a double quoted string: the worst case is therefore ‘<tt>print -P "%&lt;\\\\&lt;&lt;..."</tt>’. </p> <p>If the <var>string</var> is longer than the specified truncation length, it will appear in full, completely replacing the truncated string. </p> <p>The part of the prompt string to be truncated runs to the end of the string, or to the end of the next enclosing group of the ‘<tt>%(</tt>’ construct, or to the next truncation encountered at the same grouping level (i.e. truncations inside a ‘<tt>%(</tt>’ are separate), which ever comes first. In particular, a truncation with argument zero (e.g., ‘<tt>%&lt;&lt;</tt>’) marks the end of the range of the string to be truncated while turning off truncation from there on. For example, the prompt ‘<tt>%10&lt;...&lt;%~%&lt;&lt;%# </tt>’ will print a truncated representation of the current directory, followed by a ‘<tt>%</tt>’ or ‘<tt>#</tt>’, followed by a space. Without the ‘<tt>%&lt;&lt;</tt>’, those two characters would be included in the string to be truncated. Note that ‘<tt>%-0&lt;&lt;</tt>’ is not equivalent to ‘<tt>%&lt;&lt;</tt>’ but specifies that the prompt is truncated at the right margin. </p> <p>Truncation applies only within each individual line of the prompt, as delimited by embedded newlines (if any). If the total length of any line of the prompt after truncation is greater than the terminal width, or if the part to be truncated contains embedded newlines, truncation behavior is undefined and may change in a future version of the shell. Use ‘<tt>%-</tt><var>n</var><tt>(l.</tt><var>true-text</var><tt>.</tt><var>false-text</var><tt>)</tt>’ to remove parts of the prompt when the available space is less than <var>n</var>. </p> </dd> </dl>   <p> <font size="-1"> This document was generated on <i>May 14, 2022</i> using <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/texi2html/"><i>texi2html 5.0</i></a>. </font> <br> <font size="-1">Zsh version 5.9, released on May 14, 2022.</font> </p><div class="_attribution">
