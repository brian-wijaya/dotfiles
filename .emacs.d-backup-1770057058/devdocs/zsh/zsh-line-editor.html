The first, multiline mode, is the default. It only works if the <tt>TERM</tt> parameter is set to a valid terminal type that can move the cursor up. The second, single line mode, is used if <tt>TERM</tt> is invalid or incapable of moving the cursor up, or if the <tt>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</tt> option is set.    This mode is similar to <cite>ksh</cite>, and uses no termcap sequences. If <tt>TERM</tt> is "emacs", the <tt>ZLE</tt> option will be unset by default. </p>    <p id="index-LINES_002c-use-of">The parameters <tt>BAUD</tt>, <tt>COLUMNS</tt>, and <tt>LINES</tt> are also used by the line editor.

Highlighting of special characters and the region between the cursor and the mark (as set with <tt>set-mark-command</tt> in Emacs mode, or by <tt>visual-mode</tt> in Vi mode) is enabled by default; consult this reference for more information. Irascible conservatives will wish to know that all highlighting may be disabled by the following setting: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">zle_highlight=(none)

</div> <p>In many places, references are made to the <tt>numeric argument</tt>. This can by default be entered in emacs mode by holding the alt key and typing a number, or pressing escape before each digit, and in vi command mode by typing the number before entering a command. Generally the numeric argument causes the next command entered to be repeated the specified number of times, unless otherwise noted below; this is implemented by the <tt>digit-argument</tt> widget. See also <a href="#Arguments">Arguments</a>for some other ways the numeric argument can be modified. </p>      <h2 class="section" id="Keymaps-1">Keymaps</h2>    <p id="index-bindings_002c-key">A keymap in ZLE contains a set of bindings between key sequences and ZLE commands. The empty key sequence cannot be bound. </p> <p>There can be any number of keymaps at any time, and each keymap has one or more names. If all of a keymap’s names are deleted, it disappears.  <tt>bindkey</tt> can be used to manipulate keymap names. </p> <p>Initially, there are eight keymaps: </p> <dl compact> <dt><tt>emacs</tt></dt> <dd><p>EMACS emulation </p></dd> <dt><tt>viins</tt></dt> <dd><p>vi emulation - insert mode </p></dd> <dt><tt>vicmd</tt></dt> <dd><p>vi emulation - command mode </p></dd> <dt><tt>viopp</tt></dt> <dd><p>vi emulation - operator pending </p></dd> <dt><tt>visual</tt></dt> <dd><p>vi emulation - selection active </p></dd> <dt><tt>isearch</tt></dt> <dd><p>incremental search mode </p></dd> <dt><tt>command</tt></dt> <dd><p>read a command name </p></dd> <dt><tt>.safe</tt></dt> <dd><p>fallback keymap </p></dd> </dl> <p>The ‘<tt>.safe</tt>’ keymap is special. It can never be altered, and the name can never be removed. However, it can be linked to other names, which can be removed. In the future other special keymaps may be added; users should avoid using names beginning with ‘<tt>.</tt>’ for their own keymaps. </p>   <p id="index-EDITOR">In addition to these names, either ‘<tt>emacs</tt>’ or ‘<tt>viins</tt>’ is also linked to the name ‘<tt>main</tt>’. If one of the <tt>VISUAL</tt> or <tt>EDITOR</tt> environment variables contain the string ‘<tt>vi</tt>’ when the shell starts up then it will be ‘<tt>viins</tt>’, otherwise it will be ‘<tt>emacs</tt>’. <tt>bindkey</tt>’s <tt>-e</tt> and <tt>-v</tt> options provide a convenient way to override this default choice. </p> <p>When the editor starts up, it will select the ‘<tt>main</tt>’ keymap. If that keymap doesn’t exist, it will use ‘<tt>.safe</tt>’ instead. </p> <p>In the ‘<tt>.safe</tt>’ keymap, each single key is bound to <tt>self-insert</tt>, except for ^J (line feed) and ^M (return) which are bound to <tt>accept-line</tt>. This is deliberately not pleasant to use; if you are using it, it means you deleted the main keymap, and you should put it back. </p>    <h3 class="subsection" id="Reading-Commands">Reading Commands</h3> <p>When ZLE is reading a command from the terminal, it may read a sequence that is bound to some command and is also a prefix of a longer bound string. In this case ZLE will wait a certain time to see if more characters are typed, and if not (or they don’t match any longer string) it will execute the binding. This timeout is defined by the <tt>KEYTIMEOUT</tt> parameter; its default is 0.4 sec. There is no timeout if the prefix string is not itself bound to a command. </p> <p>The key timeout is also applied when ZLE is reading the bytes from a multibyte character string when it is in the appropriate mode. (This requires that the shell was compiled with multibyte mode enabled; typically also the locale has characters with the UTF-8 encoding, although any multibyte encoding known to the operating system is supported.) If the second or a subsequent byte is not read within the timeout period, the shell acts as if <tt>?</tt> were typed and resets the input state. </p> <p>As well as ZLE commands, key sequences can be bound to other strings, by using ‘<tt>bindkey -s</tt>’. When such a sequence is read, the replacement string is pushed back as input, and the command reading process starts again using these fake keystrokes. This input can itself invoke further replacement strings, but in order to detect loops the process will be stopped if there are twenty such replacements without a real command being read. </p> <p>A key sequence typed by the user can be turned into a command name for use in user-defined widgets with the <tt>read-command</tt> widget, described in <a href="#Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a> below. </p>    <h3 class="subsection" id="Local-Keymaps">Local Keymaps</h3>  <p id="index-local-keymaps">While for normal editing a single keymap is used exclusively, in many modes a local keymap allows for some keys to be customised. For example, in an incremental search mode, a binding in the <tt>isearch</tt> keymap will override a binding in the <tt>main</tt> keymap but all keys that are not overridden can still be used. </p> <p>If a key sequence is defined in a local keymap, it will hide a key sequence in the global keymap that is a prefix of that sequence. An example of this occurs with the binding of <tt>iw</tt> in <tt>viopp</tt> as this hides the binding of <tt>i</tt> in <tt>vicmd</tt>. However, a longer sequence in the global keymap that shares the same prefix can still apply so for example the binding of <tt>^Xa</tt> in the global keymap will be unaffected by the binding of <tt>^Xb</tt> in the local keymap. </p>     <h2 class="section" id="Zle-Builtins-1">Zle Builtins</h2>  <p id="index-zle_002c-builtin-commands">The ZLE module contains three related builtin commands. The <tt>bindkey</tt> command manipulates keymaps and key bindings; the <tt>vared</tt> command invokes ZLE on the value of a shell parameter; and the <tt>zle</tt> command manipulates editing widgets and allows command line access to ZLE commands from within shell functions. </p> <dl compact>  <dt id="index-bindkey">

For example, </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">bindkey -rpM viins '^['

The flag should be set early in the function before inspecting the value of <tt>NUMERIC</tt> or invoking other widgets. This has no effect for a widget invoked from insert mode.

<p>Redisplay the command line. If a <var>display-string</var> is given and not empty, this is shown in the status line (immediately below the line being edited). </p> <p>If the optional <var>string</var>s are given they are listed below the prompt in the same way as completion lists are printed. If no <var>string</var>s are given but the <tt>-c</tt> option is used such a list is cleared. </p> <p>Note that immediately after returning from running widgets, the command line will be redisplayed and the strings displayed will be erased. Therefore, this option is only useful for widgets that do not exit immediately after using it. </p> <p>This command can safely be called outside user defined widgets; if zle is active, the display will be refreshed, while if zle is not active, the command has no effect. In this case there will usually be no other arguments. </p> <p>The status is zero if zle was active, else one. </p> </dd> <dt>

</dt> <dd>
<p>As with the <tt>-R</tt> option, the <var>string</var> will be displayed below the command line; unlike the <tt>-R</tt> option, the string will not be put into the status line but will instead be printed normally below the prompt. This means that the <var>string</var> will still be displayed after the widget returns (until it is overwritten by subsequent commands). </p> </dd> <dt>

<p>This pushes the characters in the <var>string</var> onto the input stack of ZLE.

However, the characters in each <var>string</var> will be processed in the order in which they appear in the string. </p> </dd> <dt>

<p>Selects the keymap named <var>keymap</var>. An error message will be displayed if there is no such keymap. </p> <p>This keymap selection affects the interpretation of following keystrokes within this invocation of ZLE.

<tt>-F</tt> [ <tt>-L</tt> | <tt>-w</tt> ] [ <var>fd</var> [ <var>handler</var> ] ]</dt> <dd>
<p>Only available if your system supports one of the ‘poll’ or ‘select’ system calls; most modern systems do. </p> <p>Installs <var>handler</var> (the name of a shell function) to handle input from file descriptor <var>fd</var>. Installing a handler for an <var>fd</var> which is already handled causes the existing handler to be replaced. Any number of handlers for any number of readable file descriptors may be installed. Note that zle makes no attempt to check whether this <var>fd</var> is actually readable when installing the handler. The user must make their own arrangements for handling the file descriptor when zle is not active. </p> <p>When zle is attempting to read data, it will examine both the terminal and the list of handled <var>fd</var>’s. If data becomes available on a handled <var>fd</var>, zle calls <var>handler</var> with the fd which is ready for reading as the first argument. Under normal circumstances this is the only argument, but if an error was detected, a second argument provides details: ‘<tt>hup</tt>’ for a disconnect, ‘<tt>nval</tt>’ for a closed or otherwise invalid descriptor, or ‘<tt>err</tt>’ for any other condition. Systems that support only the ‘select’ system call always use ‘<tt>err</tt>’. </p> <p>If the option <tt>-w</tt> is also given, the <var>handler</var> is instead a line editor widget, typically a shell function made into a widget using ‘<tt>zle -N</tt>’. In that case <var>handler</var> can use all the facilities of zle to update the current editing line. Note, however, that as handling <var>fd</var> takes place at a low level changes to the display will not automatically appear; the widget should call ‘<tt>zle -R</tt>’ to force redisplay. As of this writing, widget handlers only support a single argument and thus are never passed a string for error state, so widgets must be prepared to test the descriptor themselves. </p> <p>If either type of handler produces output to the terminal, it should call ‘<tt>zle -I</tt>’ before doing so (see below). Handlers should not attempt to read from the terminal. </p> <p>If no <var>handler</var> is given, but an <var>fd</var> is present, any handler for that <var>fd</var> is removed. If there is none, an error message is printed and status 1 is returned. </p> <p>If no arguments are given, or the <tt>-L</tt> option is supplied, a list of handlers is printed in a form which can be stored for later execution. </p> <p>An <var>fd</var> (but not a <var>handler</var>) may optionally be given with the <tt>-L</tt> option; in this case, the function will list the handler if any, else silently return status 1. </p> <p>Note that this feature should be used with care. Activity on one of the <var>fd</var>’s which is not properly handled can cause the terminal to become unusable. Removing an <var>fd</var> handler from within a signal trap may cause unpredictable behavior. </p> <p>Here is a simple example of using this feature. A connection to a remote TCP port is created using the ztcp command; see <a href="zsh-modules#The-zsh_002fnet_002ftcp-Module">The zsh/net/tcp Module</a>. Then a handler is installed which simply prints out any data which arrives on this connection. Note that ‘select’ will indicate that the file descriptor needs handling if the remote side has closed the connection; we handle that by testing for a failed read. </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">if ztcp pwspc 2811; then
  tcpfd=$REPLY
  handler() {
    zle -I
    local line
    if ! read -r line &lt;&amp;$1; then
      # select marks this fd if we reach EOF,
      # so handle this specially.
      print "[Read on fd $1 failed, removing.]" &gt;&amp;2
      zle -F $1
      return 1
    fi
    print -r - $line
  }
  zle -F $tcpfd handler
fi

<p>Unusually, this option is most useful outside ordinary widget functions, though it may be used within if normal output to the terminal is required. It invalidates the current zle display in preparation for output; typically this will be from a trap function. It has no effect if zle is not active. When a trap exits, the shell checks to see if the display needs restoring, hence the following will print output in such a way as not to disturb the line being edited: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">TRAPUSR1() {
  # Invalidate zle display
  [[ -o zle ]] &amp;&amp; zle -I
  # Show output
  print Hello
}
</pre>
</div> <p>In general, the trap function may need to test whether zle is active before using this method (as shown in the example), since the <tt>zsh/zle</tt> module may not even be loaded; if it is not, the command can be skipped. </p> <p>It is possible to call ‘<tt>zle -I</tt>’ several times before control is returned to the editor; the display will only be invalidated the first time to minimise disruption. </p> <p>Note that there are normally better ways of manipulating the display from within zle widgets; see, for example, ‘<tt>zle -R</tt>’ above. </p> <p>The returned status is zero if zle was invalidated, even though this may have been by a previous call to ‘<tt>zle -I</tt>’ or by a system notification. To test if a zle widget may be called at this point, execute <tt>zle</tt> with no arguments and examine the return status. </p> </dd> <dt><tt>-T</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>This is used to add, list or remove internal transformations on the processing performed by the line editor. It is typically used only for debugging or testing and is therefore of little interest to the general user. </p> <p>‘<tt>zle -T</tt> <var>transformation</var> <var>func</var>’ specifies that the given <var>transformation</var> (see below) is effected by shell function <var>func</var>. </p> <p>‘<tt>zle -Tr</tt> <var>transformation</var>’ removes the given <var>transformation</var> if it was present (it is not an error if none was). </p> <p>‘<tt>zle -TL</tt>’ can be used to list all transformations currently in operation. </p> <p>Currently the only transformation is <tt>tc</tt>. This is used instead of outputting termcap codes to the terminal. When the transformation is in operation the shell function is passed the termcap code that would be output as its first argument; if the operation required a numeric argument, that is passed as a second argument. The function should set the shell variable <tt>REPLY</tt> to the transformed termcap code. Typically this is used to produce some simply formatted version of the code and optional argument for debugging or testing. Note that this transformation is not applied to other non-printing characters such as carriage returns and newlines. </p> </dd> <dt>

<p>Invoke the specified <var>widget</var>. This can only be done when ZLE is active; normally this will be within a user-defined widget. </p> <p>With the options <tt>-n</tt> and <tt>-N</tt>, the current numeric argument will be saved and then restored after the call to <var>widget</var>; ‘<tt>-n</tt> <var>num</var>’ sets the numeric argument temporarily to <var>num</var>, while ‘<tt>-N</tt>’ sets it to the default, i.e. as if there were none. </p> <p>With the option <tt>-K</tt>, <var>keymap</var> will be used as the current keymap during the execution of the widget. The previous keymap will be restored when the widget exits. </p> <p>Normally, calling a widget in this way does not set the special parameter <tt>WIDGET</tt> and related parameters, so that the environment appears as if the top-level widget called by the user were still active. With the option <tt>-w</tt>, <tt>WIDGET</tt> and related parameters are set to reflect the widget being executed by the <tt>zle</tt> call. </p> <p>Normally, when <var>widget</var> returns the special parameter <tt>LASTWIDGET</tt> will point to it. This can be inhibited by passing the option <tt>-f nolast</tt>. </p> <p>Any further arguments will be passed to the widget; note that as standard argument handling is performed, any general argument list should be preceded by <tt>-</tt><tt>-</tt>. If it is a shell function, these are passed down as positional parameters; for builtin widgets it is up to the widget in question what it does with them. Currently arguments are only handled by the incremental-search commands, the <tt>history-search-forward</tt> and <tt>-backward</tt> and the corresponding functions prefixed by <tt>vi-</tt>, and by <tt>universal-argument</tt>. No error is flagged if the command does not use the arguments, or only uses some of them. </p> <p>The return status reflects the success or failure of the operation carried out by the widget, or if it is a user-defined widget the return status of the shell function. </p> <p>A non-zero return status causes the shell to beep when the widget exits, unless the <tt>BEEP</tt> options was unset or the widget was called via the <tt>zle</tt> command. Thus if a user defined widget requires an immediate beep, it should call the <tt>beep</tt> widget directly. </p> </dd> </dl> </dd> </dl>     <h2 class="section" id="Zle-Widgets-1">Zle Widgets</h2>  <p id="index-widgets">All actions in the editor are performed by ‘widgets’. A widget’s job is simply to perform some small action. The ZLE commands that key sequences in keymaps are bound to are in fact widgets. Widgets can be user-defined or built in. </p> <p>The standard widgets built into ZLE are listed in <a href="#Standard-Widgets">Standard Widgets</a>. Other built-in widgets can be defined by other modules (see <a href="zsh-modules#Zsh-Modules">Zsh Modules</a>). Each built-in widget has two names: its normal canonical name, and the same name preceded by a ‘<tt>.</tt>’. The ‘<tt>.</tt>’ name is special: it can’t be rebound to a different widget. This makes the widget available even when its usual name has been redefined. </p> <p>User-defined widgets are defined using ‘<tt>zle -N</tt>’, and implemented as shell functions. When the widget is executed, the corresponding shell function is executed, and can perform editing (or other) actions. It is recommended that user-defined widgets should not have names starting with ‘<tt>.</tt>’. </p>     <h2 class="section" id="User_002dDefined-Widgets-1">User-Defined Widgets</h2>  <p id="index-widgets_002c-user_002ddefined">User-defined widgets, being implemented as shell functions, can execute any normal shell command.

The standard input of the function is redirected from /dev/null to prevent external commands from unintentionally blocking ZLE by reading from the terminal, but <tt>read -k</tt> or <tt>read -q</tt> can be used to read characters. Finally, they can examine and edit the ZLE buffer being edited by reading and setting the special parameters described below. </p>   <p id="index-parameters_002c-zle">These special parameters are always available in widget functions, but are not in any way special outside ZLE. If they have some normal value outside ZLE, that value is temporarily inaccessible, but will return when the widget function exits.

<tt>insert-last-word</tt> (<tt>ESC-_ ESC-.</tt>) (unbound) (unbound)</dt> <dd>
<p>Insert the last word from the previous history event at the cursor position. If a positive numeric argument is given, insert that word from the end of the previous history event. If the argument is zero or negative insert that word from the left (zero inserts the previous command word). Repeating this command replaces the word just inserted with the last word from the history event prior to the one just used; numeric arguments can be used in the same way to pick a word from that event. </p> <p>When called from a shell function invoked from a user-defined widget, the command can take one to three arguments. The first argument specifies a history offset which applies to successive calls to this widget: if it is -1, the default behaviour is used, while if it is 1, successive calls will move forwards through the history. The value 0 can be used to indicate that the history line examined by the previous execution of the command will be reexamined. Note that negative numbers should be preceded by a ‘<tt>-</tt><tt>-</tt>’ argument to avoid confusing them with options. </p> <p>If two arguments are given, the second specifies the word on the command line in normal array index notation (as a more natural alternative to the numeric argument). Hence 1 is the first word, and -1 (the default) is the last word. </p> <p>If a third argument is given, its value is ignored, but it is used to signify that the history offset is relative to the current history line, rather than the one remembered after the previous invocations of <tt>insert-last-word</tt>. </p> <p>For example, the default behaviour of the command corresponds to </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">zle insert-last-word -- -1 -1
</pre>
</div> <p>while the command </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">zle insert-last-word -- -1 1 -
</pre>
</div> <p>always copies the first word of the line in the history immediately before the line being edited. This has the side effect that later invocations of the widget will be relative to that line. </p>  </dd> <dt id="index-vi_002drepeat_002dsearch">

For example, if this command occurs twice, followed immediately by <tt>forward-char</tt>, move forward sixteen spaces; if instead it is followed by <tt>-2</tt>, then <tt>forward-char</tt>, move backward two spaces. </p> <p>Inside a widget function, if passed an argument, i.e. ‘<tt>zle universal-argument</tt> <var>num</var>’, the numeric argument will be set to <var>num</var>; this is equivalent to ‘<tt>NUMERIC=</tt><var>num</var>’. </p>  </dd> <dt id="index-argument_002dbase"><tt>argument-base</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>Use the existing numeric argument as a numeric base, which must be in the range 2 to 36 inclusive. Subsequent use of <tt>digit-argument</tt> and <tt>universal-argument</tt> will input a new numeric argument in the given base. The usual hexadecimal convention is used: the letter <tt>a</tt> or <tt>A</tt> corresponds to 10, and so on. Arguments in bases requiring digits from 10 upwards are more conveniently input with <tt>universal-argument</tt>, since <tt>ESC-a</tt> etc. are not usually bound to <tt>digit-argument</tt>. </p> <p>The function can be used with a command argument inside a user-defined widget. The following code sets the base to 16 and lets the user input a hexadecimal argument until a key out of the digit range is typed: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">zle argument-base 16

This is controlled by the array parameter <tt>zle_highlight</tt>, if it has been set by the user. </p> <p>If the parameter contains the single entry <tt>none</tt> all highlighting is turned off. Note the parameter is still expected to be an array. </p> <p>Otherwise each entry of the array should consist of a word indicating a context for highlighting, then a colon, then a comma-separated list of the types of highlighting to apply in that context. </p> <p>The contexts available for highlighting are the following: </p> <dl compact>  <dt id="index-region_002c-highlighting"><tt>default</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>Any text within the command line not affected by any other highlighting. Text outside the editable area of the command line is not affected. </p> </dd> <dt id="index-highlighting_002c-region"><tt>isearch</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>When one of the incremental history search widgets is active, the area of the command line matched by the search string or pattern. </p> </dd> <dt id="index-special-characters_002c-highlighting"><tt>region</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>The currently selected text. In emacs terminology, this is referred to as the region and is bounded by the cursor (point) and the mark. The region is only highlighted if it is active, which is the case after the mark is modified with <tt>set-mark-command</tt> or <tt>exchange-point-and-mark</tt>. Note that whether or not the region is active has no effect on its use within emacs style widgets, it simply determines whether it is highlighted. In vi mode, the region corresponds to selected text in visual mode. </p>   </dd> <dt id="index-highlighting_002c-special-characters"><tt>special</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>Individual characters that have no direct printable representation but are shown in a special manner by the line editor. These characters are described below. </p>    </dd> <dt id="index-completion-removable-suffix_002c-highlighting"><tt>suffix</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>This context is used in completion for characters that are marked as suffixes that will be removed if the completion ends at that point, the most obvious example being a slash (<tt>/</tt>) after a directory name. Note that suffix removal is configurable; the circumstances under which the suffix will be removed may differ for different completions. </p> </dd> <dt id="index-suffix_002c-highlighting-removable_002c-in-completion"><tt>paste</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>Following a command to paste text, the characters that were inserted. </p> </dd> </dl> <p>When <tt>region_highlight</tt> is set, the contexts that describe a region — <tt>isearch</tt>, <tt>region</tt>, <tt>suffix</tt>, and <tt>paste</tt> — are applied first, then <tt>region_highlight</tt> is applied, then the remaining <tt>zle_highlight</tt> contexts are applied. If a particular character is affected by multiple specifications, the last specification wins. </p> <p><tt>zle_highlight</tt> may contain additional fields for controlling how terminal sequences to change colours are output. Each of the following is followed by a colon and a string in the same form as for key bindings. This will not be necessary for the vast majority of terminals as the defaults shown in parentheses are widely used. </p> <dl compact>  <dt id="index-escape-sequences_002c-terminal_002c-for-highlighting">
<tt>fg_start_code</tt> (<tt>\e[3</tt>)</dt> <dd>

<p>The start of the escape sequence for the background colour. See <tt>fg_start_code</tt> above. </p> </dd> <dt>
<tt>bg_default_code</tt> (<tt>9</tt>)</dt> <dd>
<p>The number to use instead of the colour to reset the default background colour. </p> </dd> <dt>
<tt>bg_end_code</tt> (<tt>m</tt>)</dt> <dd>
<p>The end of the escape sequence for the background colour. </p> </dd> </dl> <p>The available types of highlighting are the following. Note that not all types of highlighting are available on all terminals: </p> <dl compact> <dt><tt>none</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>No highlighting is applied to the given context. It is not useful for this to appear with other types of highlighting; it is used to override a default. </p> </dd> <dt>
<tt>fg=</tt><var>colour</var>
</dt> <dd>
<p>The foreground colour should be set to <var>colour</var>, a decimal integer, the name of one of the eight most widely-supported colours or as a ‘<tt>#</tt>’ followed by an RGB triplet in hexadecimal format. </p> <p>Not all terminals support this and, of those that do, not all provide facilities to test the support, hence the user should decide based on the terminal type. Most terminals support the colours <tt>black</tt>, <tt>red</tt>, <tt>green</tt>, <tt>yellow</tt>, <tt>blue</tt>, <tt>magenta</tt>, <tt>cyan</tt> and <tt>white</tt>, which can be set by name. In addition. <tt>default</tt> may be used to set the terminal’s default foreground colour. Abbreviations are allowed; <tt>b</tt> or <tt>bl</tt> selects black. Some terminals may generate additional colours if the <tt>bold</tt> attribute is also present. </p> <p>On recent terminals and on systems with an up-to-date terminal database the number of colours supported may be tested by the command ‘<tt>echotc Co</tt>’; if this succeeds, it indicates a limit on the number of colours which will be enforced by the line editor. The number of colours is in any case limited to 256 (i.e. the range 0 to 255). </p> <p>Some modern terminal emulators have support for 24-bit true colour (16 million colours). In this case, the hex triplet format can be used. This consists of a ‘<tt>#</tt>’ followed by either a three or six digit hexadecimal number describing the red, green and blue components of the colour. Hex triplets can also be used with 88 and 256 colour terminals via the <tt>zsh/nearcolor</tt> module (see <a href="zsh-modules#The-zsh_002fnearcolor-Module">The zsh/nearcolor Module</a>). </p> <p>Colour is also known as color. </p> </dd> <dt>
<tt>bg=</tt><var>colour</var>
</dt> <dd>
<p>The background colour should be set to <var>colour</var>. This works similarly to the foreground colour, except the background is not usually affected by the bold attribute. </p> </dd> <dt><tt>bold</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>The characters in the given context are shown in a bold font. Not all terminals distinguish bold fonts. </p> </dd> <dt><tt>standout</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>The characters in the given context are shown in the terminal’s standout mode. The actual effect is specific to the terminal; on many terminals it is inverse video. On some such terminals, where the cursor does not blink it appears with standout mode negated, making it less than clear where the cursor actually is. On such terminals one of the other effects may be preferable for highlighting the region and matched search string. </p> </dd> <dt><tt>underline</tt></dt> <dd>
<p>The characters in the given context are shown underlined. Some terminals show the foreground in a different colour instead; in this case whitespace will not be highlighted. </p> </dd> </dl> <p>The characters described above as ‘special’ are as follows. The formatting described here is used irrespective of whether the characters are highlighted: </p> <dl compact> <dt>ASCII control characters</dt> <dd>
<p>Control characters in the ASCII range are shown as ‘<tt>^</tt>’ followed by the base character. </p> </dd> <dt>Unprintable multibyte characters</dt> <dd>
<p>This item applies to control characters not in the ASCII range, plus other characters as follows. If the <tt>MULTIBYTE</tt> option is in effect, multibyte characters not in the ASCII character set that are reported as having zero width are treated as combining characters when the option <tt>COMBINING_CHARS</tt> is on. If the option is off, or if a character appears where a combining character is not valid, the character is treated as unprintable. </p> <p>Unprintable multibyte characters are shown as a hexadecimal number between angle brackets. The number is the code point of the character in the wide character set; this may or may not be Unicode, depending on the operating system. </p> </dd> <dt>Invalid multibyte characters</dt> <dd>
<p>If the <tt>MULTIBYTE</tt> option is in effect, any sequence of one or more bytes that does not form a valid character in the current character set is treated as a series of bytes each shown as a special character. This case can be distinguished from other unprintable characters as the bytes are represented as two hexadecimal digits between angle brackets, as distinct from the four or eight digits that are used for unprintable characters that are nonetheless valid in the current character set. </p> <p>Not all systems support this: for it to work, the system’s representation of wide characters must be code values from the Universal Character Set, as defined by IS0 10646 (also known as Unicode). </p> </dd> <dt>Wrapped double-width characters</dt> <dd>
<p>When a double-width character appears in the final column of a line, it is instead shown on the next line. The empty space left in the original position is highlighted as a special character. </p> </dd> </dl> <p>If <tt>zle_highlight</tt> is not set or no value applies to a particular context, the defaults applied are equivalent to </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">zle_highlight=(region:standout special:standout
suffix:bold isearch:underline paste:standout)
</pre>
</div> <p>i.e. both the region and special characters are shown in standout mode. </p> <p>Within widgets, arbitrary regions may be highlighted by setting the special array parameter <tt>region_highlight</tt>; see <a href="#Zle-Widgets">Zle Widgets</a>. </p>   <p> <font size="-1"> This document was generated on <i>May 14, 2022</i> using <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/texi2html/"><i>texi2html 5.0</i></a>. </font> <br> <font size="-1">Zsh version 5.9, released on May 14, 2022.</font> </p><div class="_attribution">
