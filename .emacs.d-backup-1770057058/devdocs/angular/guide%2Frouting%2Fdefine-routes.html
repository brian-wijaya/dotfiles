<h1 tabindex="-1">Define routes</h1> <header class="docs-header"> <docs-breadcrumb ng-version="21.0.3" _nghost-ng-c3945279308 ngh="8"></docs-breadcrumb>   </header> <p>Routes serve as the fundamental building blocks for navigation within an Angular app.</p> <h2 id="what-are-routes"> What are routes? </h2> <p>In Angular, a <strong>route</strong> is an object that defines which component should render for a specific URL path or pattern, as well as additional configuration options about what happens when a user navigates to that URL.</p> <p>Here is a basic example of a route:</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { AdminPage } from './app-admin/app-admin.component';

const adminPage = {
  path: 'admin',
  component: AdminPage
}</pre>
<p>For this route, when a user visits the <code>/admin</code> path, the app will display the <code>AdminPage</code> component.</p> <h3 id="managing-routes-in-your-application"> Managing routes in your application </h3> <p>Most projects define routes in a separate file that contains <code>routes</code> in the filename.</p> <p>A collection of routes looks like this:</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomePage } from './home-page/home-page.component';
import { AdminPage } from './about-page/admin-page.component';

export const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: HomePage,
  },
  {
    path: 'admin',
    component: AdminPage,
  },
];</pre>
<p>Tip: If you generated a project with Angular CLI, your routes are defined in <code>src/app/app.routes.ts</code>.</p> <h3 id="adding-the-router-to-your-application"> Adding the router to your application </h3> <p>When bootstrapping an Angular application without the Angular CLI, you can pass a configuration object that includes a <code>providers</code> array.</p> <p>Inside of the <code>providers</code> array, you can add the Angular router to your application by adding a <a href="../../api/router/providerouter"><code>provideRouter</code></a> function call with your routes.</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core';
import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';

import { routes } from './app.routes';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideRouter(routes),
    // ...
  ]
};</pre> <h2 id="route-url-paths"> Route URL Paths </h2> <h3 id="static-url-paths"> Static URL Paths </h3> <p>Static URL Paths refer to routes with predefined paths that don't change based on dynamic parameters. These are routes that match a <code>path</code> string exactly and have a fixed outcome.</p> <p>Examples of this include:</p> <ul class="docs-list"> <li>"/admin"</li> <li>"/blog"</li> <li>"/settings/account"</li> </ul> <h3 id="define-url-paths-with-route-parameters"> Define URL Paths with Route Parameters </h3> <p>Parameterized URLs allow you to define dynamic paths that allow multiple URLs to the same component while dynamically displaying data based on parameters in the URL.</p> <p>You can define this type of pattern by adding parameters to your route’s <code>path</code> string and prefixing each parameter with the colon (<code>:</code>) character.</p> 
<div class="docs-alert docs-alert-important"> <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Parameters are distinct from information in the URL's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string" target="_blank">query string</a>. Learn more about <a href="read-route-state#query-parameters">query parameters in Angular in this guide</a>.</p> </div>  <p>The following example displays a user profile component based on the user id passed in through the URL.</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { UserProfile } from './user-profile/user-profile';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'user/:id', component: UserProfile }
];</pre>
<p>In this example, URLs such as <code>/user/leeroy</code> and <code>/user/jenkins</code> render the <code>UserProfile</code> component. This component can then read the <code>id</code> parameter and use it to perform additional work, such as fetching data. See <a href="read-route-state">reading route state guide</a> for details on reading route parameters.</p> <p>Valid route parameter names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) and can only contain:</p> <ul class="docs-list"> <li>Letters (a-z, A-Z)</li> <li>Numbers (0-9)</li> <li>Underscore (_)</li> <li>Hyphen (-)</li> </ul> <p>You can also define paths with multiple parameters:</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { UserProfile } from './user-profile/user-profile.component';
import { SocialMediaFeed } from './user-profile/social–media-feed.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'user/:id/:social-media', component: SocialMediaFeed },
  { path: 'user/:id/', component: UserProfile },
];</pre>
<p>With this new path, users can visit <code>/user/leeroy/youtube</code> and <code>/user/leeroy/bluesky</code> and see respective social media feeds based on the parameter for the user leeroy.</p> <p>See <a href="read-route-state">Reading route state</a> for details on reading route parameters.</p> <h3 id="wildcards"> Wildcards </h3> <p>When you need to catch all routes for a specific path, the solution is a wildcard route which is defined with the double asterisk (<code>**</code>).</p> <p>A common example is defining a Page Not Found component.</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { Home } from './home/home.component';
import { UserProfile } from './user-profile/user-profile.component';
import { NotFound } from './not-found/not-found.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'home', component: Home },
  { path: 'user/:id', component: UserProfile },
  { path: '**', component: NotFound }
];</pre>
<p>In this routes array, the app displays the <code>NotFound</code> component when the user visits any path outside of <code>home</code> and <code>user/:id</code>.</p> <p>Tip: Wildcard routes are typically placed at the end of a routes array.</p> <h2 id="how-angular-matches-urls"> How Angular matches URLs </h2> <p>When you define routes, the order is important because Angular uses a first-match wins strategy. This means that once Angular matches a URL with a route <code>path</code>, it stops checking any further routes. As a result, always put more specific routes before less specific routes.</p> <p>The following example shows routes defined from most-specific to least specific:</p> <pre data-language="ts">const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },              // Empty path
  { path: 'users/new', component: NewUserComponent },  // Static, most specific
  { path: 'users/:id', component: UserDetailComponent }, // Dynamic
  { path: 'users', component: UsersComponent },        // Static, less specific
  { path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent }         // Wildcard - always last
];</pre>
<p>If a user visits <code>/users/new</code>, Angular router would go through the following steps:</p> <ol class="docs-ordered-list"> <li>Checks <code>''</code> - doesn't match</li> <li>Checks <code>users/new</code> - matches! Stops here</li> <li>Never reaches <code>users/:id</code> even though it could match</li> <li>Never reaches <code>users</code>
</li> <li>Never reaches <code>**</code>
</li> </ol> <h2 id="loading-route-component-strategies"> Loading Route Component Strategies </h2> <p>Understanding how and when components load in Angular routing is crucial for building responsive web applications. Angular offers two primary strategies to control component loading behavior:</p> <ol class="docs-ordered-list"> <li>
<strong>Eagerly loaded</strong>: Components that are loaded immediately</li> <li>
<strong>Lazily loaded</strong>: Components loaded only when needed</li> </ol> <p>Each approach offers distinct advantages for different scenarios.</p> <h3 id="eagerly-loaded-components"> Eagerly loaded components </h3> <p>When you define a route with the <code>component</code> property, the referenced component is eagerly loaded as part of the same JavaScript bundle as the route configuration.</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { Routes } from "@angular/router";
import { HomePage } from "./components/home/home-page"
import { LoginPage } from "./components/auth/login-page"

export const routes: Routes = [
  // HomePage and LoginPage are both directly referenced in this config,
  // so their code is eagerly included in the same JavaScript bundle as this file.
  {
    path: "",
    component: HomePage
  },
  {
    path: "login",
    component: LoginPage
  }
]</pre>
<p>Eagerly loading route components like this means that the browser has to download and parse all of the JavaScript for these components as part of your initial page load, but the components are available to Angular immediately.</p> <p>While including more JavaScript in your initial page load leads to slower initial load times, this can lead to more seamless transitions as the user navigates through an application.</p> <h3 id="lazily-loaded-components"> Lazily loaded components </h3> <p>You can use the <code>loadComponent</code> property to lazily load the JavaScript for a route only at the point at which that route would become active.</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { Routes } from "@angular/router";

export const routes: Routes = [
  // The HomePage and LoginPage components are loaded lazily at the point at which
  // their corresponding routes become active.
  {
    path: 'login',
    loadComponent: () =&gt; import('./components/auth/login-page').then(m =&gt; m.LoginPage)
  },
  {
    path: '',
    loadComponent: () =&gt; import('./components/home/home-page').then(m =&gt; m.HomePage)
  }
]</pre>
<p>The <code>loadComponent</code> property accepts a loader function that returns a Promise that resolves to an Angular component. In most cases, this function uses the standard <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import" target="_blank">JavaScript dynamic import API</a>. You can, however, use any arbitrary async loader function.</p> <p>Lazily loading routes can significantly improve the load speed of your Angular application by removing large portions of JavaScript from the initial bundle. These portions of your code compile into separate JavaScript "chunks" that the router requests only when the user visits the corresponding route.</p> <h3 id="injection-context-lazy-loading"> Injection context lazy loading </h3> <p>The Router executes <code>loadComponent</code> and <code>loadChildren</code> within the <strong>injection context of the current route</strong>, allowing you to call <a href="../../api/core/inject"><code>inject</code></a>inside these loader functions to access providers declared on that route, inherited from parent routes through hierarchical dependency injection, or available globally. This enables context-aware lazy loading.</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { inject } from '@angular/core';
import { FeatureFlags } from './feature-flags';

export const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'dashboard',
    // Runs inside the route's injection context
    loadComponent: () =&gt; {
      const flags = inject(FeatureFlags);
      return flags.isPremium
        ? import('./dashboard/premium-dashboard').then(m =&gt; m.PremiumDashboard)
        : import('./dashboard/basic-dashboard').then(m =&gt; m.BasicDashboard);
    },
  },
];</pre> <h3 id="should-i-use-an-eager-or-a-lazy-route"> Should I use an eager or a lazy route? </h3> <p>There are many factors to consider when deciding on whether a route should be eager or lazy.</p> <p>In general, eager loading is recommended for primary landing page(s) while other pages would be lazy-loaded.</p> 
<div class="docs-alert docs-alert-note"> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> While lazy routes have the upfront performance benefit of reducing the amount of initial data requested by the user, it adds future data requests that could be undesirable. This is particularly true when dealing with nested lazy loading at multiple levels, which can significantly impact performance.</p> </div>  <h2 id="redirects"> Redirects </h2> <p>You can define a route that redirects to another route instead of rendering a component:</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { BlogComponent } from './home/blog.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'articles',
    redirectTo: '/blog',
  },
  {
    path: 'blog',
    component: BlogComponent
  },
];</pre>
<p>If you modify or remove a route, some users may still click on out-of-date links or bookmarks to that route. You can add a redirect to direct those users to an appropriate alternative route instead of a "not found" page.</p> <h2 id="page-titles"> Page titles </h2> <p>You can associate a <strong>title</strong> with each route. Angular automatically updates the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title" target="_blank">page title</a> when a route activates. Always define appropriate page titles for your application, as these titles are necessary to create an accessible experience.</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component';
import { ProductsComponent } from './products/products.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: HomeComponent,
    title: 'Home Page'
  },
  {
    path: 'about',
    component: AboutComponent,
    title: 'About Us'
  },
];</pre>
<p>The page <code>title</code> property can be set dynamincally to a resolver function using <a href="../../api/router/resolvefn"><code>ResolveFn</code></a>.</p> <pre data-language="ts">const titleResolver: ResolveFn&lt;string&gt; = (route) =&gt; route.queryParams['id'];
const routes: Routes = [
   ...
  {
    path: 'products',
    component: ProductsComponent,
    title: titleResolver,
  }
];</pre>
<p>Route titles can also be set via a service extending the <a href="../../api/router/titlestrategy"><code>TitleStrategy</code></a> abstract class. By default, Angular uses the <a href="../../api/router/defaulttitlestrategy"><code>DefaultTitleStrategy</code></a>.</p> <h3 id="using-titlestrategy-for-page-titles"> Using TitleStrategy for page titles </h3> <p>For advanced scenarios where you need centralized control over how the document title is composed, implement a <a href="../../api/router/titlestrategy"><code>TitleStrategy</code></a>.</p> <p><a href="../../api/router/titlestrategy"><code>TitleStrategy</code></a> is a token you can provide to override the default title strategy used by Angular. You can supply a custom <a href="../../api/router/titlestrategy"><code>TitleStrategy</code></a> to implement conventions such as adding an application suffix, formatting titles from breadcrumbs, or generating titles dynamically from route data.</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Title } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { TitleStrategy, RouterStateSnapshot } from '@angular/router';

@Injectable()
export class AppTitleStrategy extends TitleStrategy {
  private readonly title = inject(Title);

  updateTitle(snapshot: RouterStateSnapshot): void {
    // PageTitle is equal to the "Title" of a route if it's set
    // If its not set it will use the "title" given in index.html
    const pageTitle = this.buildTitle(snapshot) || this.title.getTitle();
    this.title.setTitle(`MyAwesomeApp - ${pageTitle}`);
  }
}</pre>
<p>To use the custom strategy, provide it with the <a href="../../api/router/titlestrategy"><code>TitleStrategy</code></a> token at the application level:</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { provideRouter, TitleStrategy } from '@angular/router';
import { AppTitleStrategy } from './app-title.strategy';

export const appConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideRouter(routes),
    { provide: TitleStrategy, useClass: AppTitleStrategy },
  ],
};</pre> <h2 id="route-level-providers-for-dependency-injection"> Route-level providers for dependency injection </h2> <p>Each route has a <code>providers</code> property that lets you provide dependencies to that route's content via <a href="../di">dependency injection</a>.</p> <p>Common scenarios where this can be helpful include applications that have different services based on whether the user is an admin or not.</p> <pre data-language="ts">export const ROUTES: Route[] = [
  {
    path: 'admin',
    providers: [
      AdminService,
      {provide: ADMIN_API_KEY, useValue: '12345'},
    ],
    children: [
      {path: 'users', component: AdminUsersComponent},
      {path: 'teams', component: AdminTeamsComponent},
    ],
  },
  // ... other application routes that don't
  //     have access to ADMIN_API_KEY or AdminService.
];</pre>
<p>In this code sample, the <code>admin</code> path contains a protected data property of <code>ADMIN_API_KEY</code> that is only available to children within its section. As a result, no other paths will be able to access the data provided via <code>ADMIN_API_KEY</code>.</p> <p>See the <a href="../di">Dependency injection guide</a> for more information about providers and injection in Angular.</p> <h2 id="associating-data-with-routes"> Associating data with routes </h2> <p>Route data enables you to attach additional information to routes. You are able to configure how components behave based on this data.</p> <p>There are two ways to work with route data: static data that remains constant, and dynamic data that can change based on runtime conditions.</p> <h3 id="static-data"> Static data </h3> <p>You can associate arbitrary static data with a route via the <code>data</code> property in order to centralize things like route-specific metadata (e.g., analytics tracking, permissions, etc.):</p> <pre data-language="ts">import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component';
import { ProductsComponent } from './products/products.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'about',
    component: AboutComponent,
    data: { analyticsId: '456' }
  },
  {
    path: '',
    component: HomeComponent,
    data: { analyticsId: '123' }
  }
];</pre>
<p>In this code sample, the home and about page are configured with specific <code>analyticsId</code> which would then be used in their respective components for page tracking analytics.</p> <p>You can read this static data by injecting the <a href="../../api/router/activatedroute"><code>ActivatedRoute</code></a>. See <a href="read-route-state">Reading route state</a> for details.</p> <h3 id="dynamic-data-with-data-resolvers"> Dynamic data with data resolvers </h3> <p>When you need to provide dynamic data to a
