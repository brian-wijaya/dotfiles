<header><h1>JSR Protocol</h1></header><p>The <code>jsr:</code> protocol fetches packages from the <a href="https://jsr.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSR registry</a>.</p>  <p>Note that because the JSR registry is responsible for compiling packages from TypeScript to JavaScript they sometimes re-pack packages. As a result, the Yarn lockfile contains the full tarball URLs.</p> <p>Quoting the <a href="https://jsr.io/docs/npm-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSR documentation</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The specific tarballs advertised for a given version of a package may change over time, even if the version itself is not changed. This is because the JSR registry may re-generate npm compatible tarballs for a package version to fix compatibility issues with npm or improve the transpile output in the generated tarball. We refer to this as the “revision” of a tarball. The revision of a tarball is not advertised in the npm registry endpoint, but it is included in the URL of the tarball itself and is included in the <code>package.json</code> file in the tarball at the <code>_jsr_revision</code> field. The revision of a tarball is not considered part of the package version, and does not affect semver resolution.</p> <p>However, tarball URLs are immutable. Tools that have a reference to a specific tarball URL will always be able to download that exact tarball. When a new revision of a tarball is generated, the old tarball is not deleted and will continue to be available at the same URL. The new tarball will be available at a new URL that includes the new revision.</p> <p>Because the tarball URL is included in package manager lock files, running <code>npm i</code> / <span class="inline_hdsZ"><code><span class="token_Ye2a" data-type="binary">yarn</span></code></span> / <code>pnpm i</code> will never accidentally download a new revision of the tarball.</p> </blockquote><div class="_attribution">
