<h1> Command v2  </h1>     <p>Package json implements semantic processing of JSON as specified in RFC 8259. JSON is a simple data interchange format that can represent primitive data types such as booleans, strings, and numbers, in addition to structured data types such as objects and arrays. </p>
<p>This package (encoding/json/v2) is experimental, and not subject to the Go 1 compatibility promise. It only exists when building with the GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 environment variable set. Most users should use <span>encoding/json</span>. </p>
<p><a href="#Marshal">Marshal</a> and <a href="#Unmarshal">Unmarshal</a> encode and decode Go values to/from JSON text contained within a []byte. <a href="#MarshalWrite">MarshalWrite</a> and <a href="#UnmarshalRead">UnmarshalRead</a> operate on JSON text by writing to or reading from an <span>io.Writer</span> or <span>io.Reader</span>. <a href="#MarshalEncode">MarshalEncode</a> and <a href="#UnmarshalDecode">UnmarshalDecode</a> operate on JSON text by encoding to or decoding from a <span>jsontext.Encoder</span> or <span>jsontext.Decoder</span>. <a href="#Options">Options</a> may be passed to each of the marshal or unmarshal functions to configure the semantic behavior of marshaling and unmarshaling (i.e., alter how JSON data is understood as Go data and vice versa). <span>jsontext.Options</span> may also be passed to the marshal or unmarshal functions to configure the syntactic behavior of encoding or decoding. </p>
<p>The data types of JSON are mapped to/from the data types of Go based on the closest logical equivalent between the two type systems. For example, a JSON boolean corresponds with a Go bool, a JSON string corresponds with a Go string, a JSON number corresponds with a Go int, uint or float, a JSON array corresponds with a Go slice or array, and a JSON object corresponds with a Go struct or map. See the documentation on <a href="#Marshal">Marshal</a> and <a href="#Unmarshal">Unmarshal</a> for a comprehensive list of how the JSON and Go type systems correspond. </p>
<p>Arbitrary Go types can customize their JSON representation by implementing <a href="#Marshaler">Marshaler</a>, <a href="#MarshalerTo">MarshalerTo</a>, <a href="#Unmarshaler">Unmarshaler</a>, or <a href="#UnmarshalerFrom">UnmarshalerFrom</a>. This provides authors of Go types with control over how their types are serialized as JSON. Alternatively, users can implement functions that match <a href="#MarshalFunc">MarshalFunc</a>, <a href="#MarshalToFunc">MarshalToFunc</a>, <a href="#UnmarshalFunc">UnmarshalFunc</a>, or <a href="#UnmarshalFromFunc">UnmarshalFromFunc</a> to specify the JSON representation for arbitrary types. This provides callers of JSON functionality with control over how any arbitrary type is serialized as JSON. </p>
<h3 id="hdr-JSON_Representation_of_Go_structs">JSON Representation of Go structs</h3> <p>A Go struct is naturally represented as a JSON object, where each Go struct field corresponds with a JSON object member. When marshaling, all Go struct fields are recursively encoded in depth-first order as JSON object members except those that are ignored or omitted. When unmarshaling, JSON object members are recursively decoded into the corresponding Go struct fields. Object members that do not match any struct fields, also known as “unknown members”, are ignored by default or rejected if <a href="#RejectUnknownMembers">RejectUnknownMembers</a> is specified. </p>
<p>The representation of each struct field can be customized in the "json" struct field tag, where the tag is a comma separated list of options. As a special case, if the entire tag is `json:"-"`, then the field is ignored with regard to its JSON representation. Some options also have equivalent behavior controlled by a caller-specified <a href="#Options">Options</a>. Field-specified options take precedence over caller-specified options. </p>
<p>The first option is the JSON object name override for the Go struct field. If the name is not specified, then the Go struct field name is used as the JSON object name. JSON names containing commas or quotes, or names identical to "" or "-", can be specified using a single-quoted string literal, where the syntax is identical to the Go grammar for a double-quoted string literal, but instead uses single quotes as the delimiters. By default, unmarshaling uses case-sensitive matching to identify the Go struct field associated with a JSON object name. </p>
<p>After the name, the following tag options are supported: </p>
<ul> <li><p>omitzero: When marshaling, the "omitzero" option specifies that the struct field should be omitted if the field value is zero as determined by the "IsZero() bool" method if present, otherwise based on whether the field is the zero Go value. This option has no effect when unmarshaling. </p></li>
<li><p>omitempty: When marshaling, the "omitempty" option specifies that the struct field should be omitted if the field value would have been encoded as a JSON null, empty string, empty object, or empty array. This option has no effect when unmarshaling. </p></li>
<li><p>string: The "string" option specifies that <a href="#StringifyNumbers">StringifyNumbers</a> be set when marshaling or unmarshaling a struct field value. This causes numeric types to be encoded as a JSON number within a JSON string, and to be decoded from a JSON string containing the JSON number without any surrounding whitespace. This extra level of encoding is often necessary since many JSON parsers cannot precisely represent 64-bit integers. </p></li>
<li><p>case: When unmarshaling, the "case" option specifies how JSON object names are matched with the JSON name for Go struct fields. The option is a key-value pair specified as "case:value" where the value must either be 'ignore' or 'strict'. The 'ignore' value specifies that matching is case-insensitive where dashes and underscores are also ignored. If multiple fields match, the first declared field in breadth-first order takes precedence. The 'strict' value specifies that matching is case-sensitive. This takes precedence over the <a href="#MatchCaseInsensitiveNames">MatchCaseInsensitiveNames</a> option. </p></li>
<li><p>inline: The "inline" option specifies that the JSON representable content of this field type is to be promoted as if they were specified in the parent struct. It is the JSON equivalent of Go struct embedding. A Go embedded field is implicitly inlined unless an explicit JSON name is specified. The inlined field must be a Go struct (that does not implement any JSON methods), <span>jsontext.Value</span>, map[~string]T, or an unnamed pointer to such types. When marshaling, inlined fields from a pointer type are omitted if it is nil. Inlined fields of type <span>jsontext.Value</span> and map[~string]T are called “inlined fallbacks” as they can represent all possible JSON object members not directly handled by the parent struct. Only one inlined fallback field may be specified in a struct, while many non-fallback fields may be specified. This option must not be specified with any other option (including the JSON name). </p></li>
<li><p>unknown: The "unknown" option is a specialized variant of the inlined fallback to indicate that this Go struct field contains any number of unknown JSON object members. The field type must be a <span>jsontext.Value</span>, map[~string]T, or an unnamed pointer to such types. If <a href="#DiscardUnknownMembers">DiscardUnknownMembers</a> is specified when marshaling, the contents of this field are ignored. If <a href="#RejectUnknownMembers">RejectUnknownMembers</a> is specified when unmarshaling, any unknown object members are rejected regardless of whether an inlined fallback with the "unknown" option exists. This option must not be specified with any other option (including the JSON name). </p></li>
<li><p>format: The "format" option specifies a format flag used to specialize the formatting of the field value. The option is a key-value pair specified as "format:value" where the value must be either a literal consisting of letters and numbers (e.g., "format:RFC3339") or a single-quoted string literal (e.g., "format:'2006-01-02'"). The interpretation of the format flag is determined by the struct field type. </p></li>
</ul> <p>The "omitzero" and "omitempty" options are mostly semantically identical. The former is defined in terms of the Go type system, while the latter in terms of the JSON type system. Consequently they behave differently in some circumstances. For example, only a nil slice or map is omitted under "omitzero", while an empty slice or map is omitted under "omitempty" regardless of nilness. The "omitzero" option is useful for types with a well-defined zero value (e.g., <span>net/netip.Addr</span>) or have an IsZero method (e.g., <span>time.Time.IsZero</span>). </p>
<p>Every Go struct corresponds to a list of JSON representable fields which is constructed by performing a breadth-first search over all struct fields (excluding unexported or ignored fields), where the search recursively descends into inlined structs. The set of non-inlined fields in a struct must have unique JSON names. If multiple fields all have the same JSON name, then the one at shallowest depth takes precedence and the other fields at deeper depths are excluded from the list of JSON representable fields. If multiple fields at the shallowest depth have the same JSON name, but exactly one is explicitly tagged with a JSON name, then that field takes precedence and all others are excluded from the list. This is analogous to Go visibility rules for struct field selection with embedded struct types. </p>
<p>Marshaling or unmarshaling a non-empty struct without any JSON representable fields results in a <a href="#SemanticError">SemanticError</a>. Unexported fields must not have any `json` tags except for `json:"-"`. </p>
<h3 id="hdr-Security_Considerations">Security Considerations</h3> <p>JSON is frequently used as a data interchange format to communicate between different systems, possibly implemented in different languages. For interoperability and security reasons, it is important that all implementations agree upon the semantic meaning of the data. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avilmOcHKHE&amp;t=1057s">For example, suppose we have two micro-services.</a> The first service is responsible for authenticating a JSON request, while the second service is responsible for executing the request (having assumed that the prior service authenticated the request). If an attacker were able to maliciously craft a JSON request such that both services believe that the same request is from different users, it could bypass the authenticator with valid credentials for one user, but maliciously perform an action on behalf of a different user. </p>
<p>According to RFC 8259, there unfortunately exist many JSON texts that are syntactically valid but semantically ambiguous. For example, the standard does not define how to interpret duplicate names within an object. </p>
<p>The v1 <span>encoding/json</span> and <span>encoding/json/v2</span> packages interpret some inputs in different ways. In particular: </p>
<ul> <li><p>The standard specifies that JSON must be encoded using UTF-8. By default, v1 replaces invalid bytes of UTF-8 in JSON strings with the Unicode replacement character, while v2 rejects inputs with invalid UTF-8. To change the default, specify the <span>jsontext.AllowInvalidUTF8</span> option. The replacement of invalid UTF-8 is a form of data corruption that alters the precise meaning of strings. </p></li>
<li><p>The standard does not specify a particular behavior when duplicate names are encountered within a JSON object, which means that different implementations may behave differently. By default, v1 allows for the presence of duplicate names, while v2 rejects duplicate names. To change the default, specify the <span>jsontext.AllowDuplicateNames</span> option. If allowed, object members are processed in the order they are observed, meaning that later values will replace or be merged into prior values, depending on the Go value type. </p></li>
<li><p>The standard defines a JSON object as an unordered collection of name/value pairs. While ordering can be observed through the underlying <span>jsontext</span> API, both v1 and v2 generally avoid exposing the ordering. No application should semantically depend on the order of object members. Allowing duplicate names is a vector through which ordering of members can accidentally be observed and depended upon. </p></li>
<li><p>The standard suggests that JSON object names are typically compared based on equality of the sequence of Unicode code points, which implies that comparing names is often case-sensitive. When unmarshaling a JSON object into a Go struct, by default, v1 uses a (loose) case-insensitive match on the name, while v2 uses a (strict) case-sensitive match on the name. To change the default, specify the <a href="#MatchCaseInsensitiveNames">MatchCaseInsensitiveNames</a> option. The use of case-insensitive matching provides another vector through which duplicate names can occur. Allowing case-insensitive matching means that v1 or v2 might interpret JSON objects differently from most other JSON implementations (which typically use a case-sensitive match). </p></li>
<li><p>The standard does not specify a particular behavior when an unknown name in a JSON object is encountered. When unmarshaling a JSON object into a Go struct, by default both v1 and v2 ignore unknown names and their corresponding values. To change the default, specify the <a href="#RejectUnknownMembers">RejectUnknownMembers</a> option. </p></li>
<li><p>The standard suggests that implementations may use a float64 to represent a JSON number. Consequently, large JSON integers may lose precision when stored as a floating-point type. Both v1 and v2 correctly preserve precision when marshaling and unmarshaling a concrete integer type. However, even if v1 and v2 preserve precision for concrete types, other JSON implementations may not be able to preserve precision for outputs produced by v1 or v2. The `string` tag option can be used to specify that an integer type is to be quoted within a JSON string to avoid loss of precision. Furthermore, v1 and v2 may still lose precision when unmarshaling into an any interface value, where unmarshal uses a float64 by default to represent a JSON number. To change the default, specify the <a href="#WithUnmarshalers">WithUnmarshalers</a> option with a custom unmarshaler that pre-populates the interface value with a concrete Go type that can preserve precision. </p></li>
</ul> <p>RFC 8785 specifies a canonical form for any JSON text, which explicitly defines specific behaviors that RFC 8259 leaves undefined. In theory, if a text can successfully <span>jsontext.Value.Canonicalize</span> without changing the semantic meaning of the data, then it provides a greater degree of confidence that the data is more secure and interoperable. </p>
<p>The v2 API generally chooses more secure defaults than v1, but care should still be taken with large integers or unknown members. </p><div class="_attribution">
