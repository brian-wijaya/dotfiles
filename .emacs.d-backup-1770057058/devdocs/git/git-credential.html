<h1>git-credential</h1>  <h2 id="_name">Name</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>git-credential - Retrieve and store user credentials</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_synopsis">Synopsis</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>'git credential' (fill|approve|reject|capability)</pre> </div> </div> </div>   <h2 id="_description">Description</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Git has an internal interface for storing and retrieving credentials from system-specific helpers, as well as prompting the user for usernames and passwords. The git-credential command exposes this interface to scripts which may want to retrieve, store, or prompt for credentials in the same manner as Git. The design of this scriptable interface models the internal C API; see credential.h for more background on the concepts.</p>   <p>git-credential takes an "action" option on the command-line (one of <span class="synopsis"><code>fill</code></span>, <span class="synopsis"><code>approve</code></span>, or <span class="synopsis"><code>reject</code></span>) and reads a credential description on stdin (see <a href="#IOFMT">INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT</a>).</p>   <p>If the action is <span class="synopsis"><code>fill</code></span>, git-credential will attempt to add "username" and "password" attributes to the description by reading config files, by contacting any configured credential helpers, or by prompting the user. The username and password attributes of the credential description are then printed to stdout together with the attributes already provided.</p>   <p>If the action is <span class="synopsis"><code>approve</code></span>, git-credential will send the description to any configured credential helpers, which may store the credential for later use.</p>   <p>If the action is <span class="synopsis"><code>reject</code></span>, git-credential will send the description to any configured credential helpers, which may erase any stored credentials matching the description.</p>   <p>If the action is <span class="synopsis"><code>capability</code></span>, git-credential will announce any capabilities it supports to standard output.</p>   <p>If the action is <span class="synopsis"><code>approve</code></span> or <span class="synopsis"><code>reject</code></span>, no output should be emitted.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_typical_use_of_git_credential">Typical use of git credential</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>An application using git-credential will typically use <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>credential</code></span> following these steps:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>Generate a credential description based on the context.</p>  <p>For example, if we want a password for <span class="synopsis"><code>https://example.com/foo.git</code></span>, we might generate the following credential description (don’t forget the blank line at the end; it tells <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>credential</code></span> that the application finished feeding all the information it has):</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>protocol=https
host=example.com
path=foo.git</pre> </div> </div> </li> <li> <p>Ask git-credential to give us a username and password for this description. This is done by running <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>credential</code> <code>fill</code></span>, feeding the description from step (1) to its standard input. The complete credential description (including the credential per se, i.e. the login and password) will be produced on standard output, like:</p> <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>protocol=https
host=example.com
username=bob
password=secr3t</pre> </div> </div>  <p>In most cases, this means the attributes given in the input will be repeated in the output, but Git may also modify the credential description, for example by removing the <span class="synopsis"><code>path</code></span> attribute when the protocol is HTTP(s) and <span class="synopsis"><code>credential.useHttpPath</code></span> is false.</p>   <p>If the <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>credential</code></span> knew about the password, this step may not have involved the user actually typing this password (the user may have typed a password to unlock the keychain instead, or no user interaction was done if the keychain was already unlocked) before it returned <span class="synopsis"><code>password=secr3t</code></span>.</p>  </li> <li> <p>Use the credential (e.g., access the URL with the username and password from step (2)), and see if it’s accepted.</p> </li> <li> <p>Report on the success or failure of the password. If the credential allowed the operation to complete successfully, then it can be marked with an "approve" action to tell <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>credential</code></span> to reuse it in its next invocation. If the credential was rejected during the operation, use the "reject" action so that <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>credential</code></span> will ask for a new password in its next invocation. In either case, <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>credential</code></span> should be fed with the credential description obtained from step (2) (which also contains the fields provided in step (1)).</p> </li> </ol> </div> </div>   <h2 id="IOFMT">Input/output format</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p><span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>credential</code></span> reads and/or writes (depending on the action used) credential information in its standard input/output. This information can correspond either to keys for which <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>credential</code></span> will obtain the login information (e.g. host, protocol, path), or to the actual credential data to be obtained (username/password).</p>   <p>The credential is split into a set of named attributes, with one attribute per line. Each attribute is specified by a key-value pair, separated by an <span class="synopsis"><code>=</code></span> (equals) sign, followed by a newline.</p>   <p>The key may contain any bytes except <span class="synopsis"><code>=</code></span>, newline, or NUL. The value may contain any bytes except newline or NUL. A line, including the trailing newline, may not exceed 65535 bytes in order to allow implementations to parse efficiently.</p>   <p>Attributes with keys that end with C-style array brackets <span class="synopsis">[]</span> can have multiple values. Each instance of a multi-valued attribute forms an ordered list of values - the order of the repeated attributes defines the order of the values. An empty multi-valued attribute (<span class="synopsis"><em>key[]=\n</em></span>) acts to clear any previous entries and reset the list.</p>   <p>In all cases, all bytes are treated as-is (i.e., there is no quoting, and one cannot transmit a value with newline or NUL in it). The list of attributes is terminated by a blank line or end-of-file.</p>   <p>Git understands the following attributes:</p>  <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-spanclasssynopsiscodeprotocolcodespan">

<span class="synopsis"><code>url</code></span> </dt> <dd> <p>When this special attribute is read by <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>credential</code></span>, the value is parsed as a URL and treated as if its constituent parts were read (e.g., <span class="synopsis"><code>url=https://example.com</code></span> would behave as if <span class="synopsis"><code>protocol=https</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>host=example.com</code></span> had been provided). This can help callers avoid parsing URLs themselves.</p>  <p>Note that specifying a protocol is mandatory and if the URL doesn’t specify a hostname (e.g., "cert:///path/to/file") the credential will contain a hostname attribute whose value is an empty string.</p>   <p>Components which are missing from the URL (e.g., there is no username in the example above) will be left unset.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-spanclasssynopsiscodeauthtypecodespan">
<span class="synopsis"><code>authtype</code></span> </dt> <dd> <p>This indicates that the authentication scheme in question should be used. Common values for HTTP and HTTPS include <span class="synopsis"><code>basic</code></span>, <span class="synopsis"><code>bearer</code></span>, and <span class="synopsis"><code>digest</code></span>, although the latter is insecure and should not be used. If <span class="synopsis"><code>credential</code></span> is used, this may be set to an arbitrary string suitable for the protocol in question (usually HTTP).</p>  <p>This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see below) is provided on input.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-spanclasssynopsiscodecredentialcodespan">

If this key is sent, <span class="synopsis"><code>authtype</code></span> is mandatory, and <span class="synopsis"><code>username</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>password</code></span> are not used. For HTTP, Git concatenates the <span class="synopsis"><code>authtype</code></span> value and this value with a single space to determine the <span class="synopsis"><code>Authorization</code></span> header.</p>  <p>This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see below) is provided on input.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-spanclasssynopsiscodeephemeralcodespan">

For example, an HTTP Digest <span class="synopsis"><code>credential</code></span> value is computed using a nonce and reusing it will not result in successful authentication. This may also be used for situations with short duration (e.g., 24-hour) credentials. The default value is false.</p>  <p>The credential helper will still be invoked with <span class="synopsis"><code>store</code></span> or <span class="synopsis"><code>erase</code></span> so that it can determine whether the operation was successful.</p>   <p>This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see below) is provided on input.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-credential.txt-spanclasssynopsiscodestatecodespan">

<span class="synopsis"><code>continue</code></span> </dt> <dd> <p>This is a boolean value, which, if enabled, indicates that this authentication is a non-final part of a multistage authentication step. This is common in protocols such as NTLM and Kerberos, where two rounds of client authentication are required, and setting this flag allows the credential helper to implement the multistage authentication step. This flag should only be sent if a further stage is required; that is, if another round of authentication is expected.</p>  <p>This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see below) is provided on input.

First, a <span class="synopsis"><code>version</code> <code>0</code></span> announcement is made to indicate the current version of the protocol, and then each capability is announced with a line like <span class="synopsis"><code>capability</code> <code>authtype</code></span>. Credential helpers may also implement this format, again with the <span class="synopsis"><code>capability</code></span> argument. Additional lines may be added in the future; callers should ignore lines which they don’t understand.</p>   <p>Because this is a new part of the credential helper protocol, older versions of Git, as well as some credential helpers, may not support it. If a non-zero exit status is received, or if the first line doesn’t start with the word <span class="synopsis"><code>version</code></span> and a space, callers should assume that no capabilities are supported.</p>   <p>The intention of this format is to differentiate it from the credential output in an unambiguous way. It is possible to use very simple credential helpers (e.g., inline shell scripts) which always produce identical output. Using a distinct format allows users to continue to use this syntax without having to worry about correctly implementing capability advertisements or accidentally confusing callers querying for capabilities.</p>  </div>      <h3 hidden="true" data-pagefind-weight="10">credential</h3><div class="_attribution">
