While many branch tips tend to be updated often, most tags and some branch tips are never updated. When a repository has hundreds or thousands of tags, this one-file-per-ref format both wastes storage and hurts performance.</p>   <p>This command is used to solve the storage and performance problem by storing the refs in a single file, <span class="synopsis"><code>$GIT_DIR/packed-refs</code></span>. When a ref is missing from the traditional <span class="synopsis"><code>$GIT_DIR/refs</code></span> directory hierarchy, it is looked up in this file and used if found.</p>   <p>Subsequent updates to branches always create new files under <span class="synopsis"><code>$GIT_DIR/refs</code></span> directory hierarchy.</p>   <p>A recommended practice to deal with a repository with too many refs is to pack its refs with <span class="synopsis"><code>--all</code></span> once, and occasionally run <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>pack-refs</code></span>. Tags are by definition stationary and are not expected to change. Branch heads will be packed with the initial <span class="synopsis"><code>pack-refs</code> <code>--all</code></span>, but only the currently active branch heads will become unpacked, and the next <span class="synopsis"><code>pack-refs</code></span> (without <span class="synopsis"><code>--all</code></span>) will leave them unpacked.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_options">Options</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-pack-refs.txt---all">
--all </dt> <dd> <p>The command by default packs all tags and refs that are already packed, and leaves other refs alone. This is because branches are expected to be actively developed and packing their tips does not help performance. This option causes all refs to be packed as well, with the exception of hidden refs, broken refs, and symbolic refs. Useful for a repository with many branches of historical interests.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-pack-refs.txt---no-prune">
--no-prune </dt> <dd> <p>The command usually removes loose refs under <span class="synopsis"><code>$GIT_DIR/refs</code></span> hierarchy after packing them. This option tells it not to.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-pack-refs.txt---auto">
--auto </dt> <dd> <p>Pack refs as needed depending on the current state of the ref database. The behavior depends on the ref format used by the repository and may change in the future.</p> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>"files": Loose references are packed into the <span class="synopsis"><code>packed-refs</code></span> file based on the ratio of loose references to the size of the <span class="synopsis"><code>packed-refs</code></span> file. The bigger the <span class="synopsis"><code>packed-refs</code></span> file, the more loose references need to exist before we repack.</p> </li> <li> <p>"reftable": Tables are compacted such that they form a geometric sequence. For two tables N and N+1, where N+1 is newer, this maintains the property that N is at least twice as big as N+1. Only tables that violate this property are compacted.</p> </li> </ul> </div> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-pack-refs.txt---includeltpatterngt">
