You may not want to use the plumbing directly very often, but it can be good to know what the plumbing does when the porcelain isn’t flushing.</p>   <p>Back when this document was originally written, many porcelain commands were shell scripts. For simplicity, it still uses them as examples to illustrate how plumbing is fit together to form the porcelain commands. The source tree includes some of these scripts in contrib/examples/ for reference. Although these are not implemented as shell scripts anymore, the description of what the plumbing layer commands do is still valid.</p>  <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <div class="title">Note</div> </td> <td class="content"> Deeper technical details are often marked as Notes, which you can skip on your first reading. </td> </tr> </table> </div> </div>   <h2 id="_creating_a_git_repository">Creating a git repository</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Creating a new Git repository couldn’t be easier: all Git repositories start out empty, and the only thing you need to do is find yourself a subdirectory that you want to use as a working tree - either an empty one for a totally new project, or an existing working tree that you want to import into Git.</p>   <p>For our first example, we’re going to start a totally new repository from scratch, with no pre-existing files, and we’ll call it <code>git-tutorial</code>. To start up, create a subdirectory for it, change into that subdirectory, and initialize the Git infrastructure with <code>git init</code>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ mkdir git-tutorial
$ cd git-tutorial
$ git init</pre> </div> </div>  <p>to which Git will reply</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>Initialized empty Git repository in .git/</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which is just Git’s way of saying that you haven’t been doing anything strange, and that it will have created a local <span class="synopsis"><code>.git</code></span> directory setup for your new project. You will now have a <span class="synopsis"><code>.git</code></span> directory, and you can inspect that with <code>ls</code>. For your new empty project, it should show you three entries, among other things:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>a file called <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD</code></span>, that has <span class="synopsis"><code>ref:</code> <code>refs/heads/master</code></span> in it. This is similar to a symbolic link and points at <span class="synopsis"><code>refs/heads/master</code></span> relative to the <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD</code></span> file.</p>  <p>Don’t worry about the fact that the file that the <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD</code></span> link points to doesn’t even exist yet — you haven’t created the commit that will start your <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD</code></span> development branch yet.</p>  </li> <li> <p>a subdirectory called <span class="synopsis"><code>objects</code></span>, which will contain all the objects of your project. You should never have any real reason to look at the objects directly, but you might want to know that these objects are what contains all the real <code>data</code> in your repository.</p> </li> <li> <p>a subdirectory called <span class="synopsis"><code>refs</code></span>, which contains references to objects.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>In particular, the <span class="synopsis"><code>refs</code></span> subdirectory will contain two other subdirectories, named <span class="synopsis"><code>heads</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>tags</code></span> respectively. They do exactly what their names imply: they contain references to any number of different <code>heads</code> of development (aka <code>branches</code>), and to any <code>tags</code> that you have created to name specific versions in your repository.</p>   <p>One note: the special <span class="synopsis"><code>master</code></span> head is the default branch, which is why the <span class="synopsis"><code>.git/HEAD</code></span> file was created points to it even if it doesn’t yet exist. Basically, the <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD</code></span> link is supposed to always point to the branch you are working on right now, and you always start out expecting to work on the <span class="synopsis"><code>master</code></span> branch.</p>   <p>However, this is only a convention, and you can name your branches anything you want, and don’t have to ever even <code>have</code> a <span class="synopsis"><code>master</code></span> branch. A number of the Git tools will assume that <span class="synopsis"><code>.git/HEAD</code></span> is valid, though.</p>  <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <div class="title">Note</div> </td> <td class="content"> An <em>object</em> is identified by its 160-bit SHA-1 hash, aka <em>object name</em>, and a reference to an object is always the 40-byte hex representation of that SHA-1 name. The files in the <span class="synopsis"><code>refs</code></span> subdirectory are expected to contain these hex references (usually with a final <span class="synopsis"><em>\n</em></span> at the end), and you should thus expect to see a number of 41-byte files containing these references in these <span class="synopsis"><code>refs</code></span> subdirectories when you actually start populating your tree. </td> </tr> </table> </div> <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <div class="title">Note</div> </td> <td class="content"> An advanced user may want to take a look at <a href="gitrepository-layout">gitrepository-layout[5]</a> after finishing this tutorial. </td> </tr> </table> </div>  <p>You have now created your first Git repository. Of course, since it’s empty, that’s not very useful, so let’s start populating it with data.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_populating_a_git_repository">Populating a git repository</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>We’ll keep this simple and stupid, so we’ll start off with populating a few trivial files just to get a feel for it.</p>   <p>Start off with just creating any random files that you want to maintain in your Git repository. We’ll start off with a few bad examples, just to get a feel for how this works:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ echo "Hello World" &gt;hello
$ echo "Silly example" &gt;example</pre> </div> </div>  <p>you have now created two files in your working tree (aka <code>working directory</code>), but to actually check in your hard work, you will have to go through two steps:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>fill in the <code>index</code> file (aka <code>cache</code>) with the information about your working tree state.</p> </li> <li> <p>commit that index file as an object.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>The first step is trivial: when you want to tell Git about any changes to your working tree, you use the <code>git update-index</code> program. That program normally just takes a list of filenames you want to update, but to avoid trivial mistakes, it refuses to add new entries to the index (or remove existing ones) unless you explicitly tell it that you’re adding a new entry with the <span class="synopsis"><code>--add</code></span> flag (or removing an entry with the <span class="synopsis"><code>--remove</code></span>) flag.</p>   <p>So to populate the index with the two files you just created, you can do</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git update-index --add hello example</pre> </div> </div>  <p>and you have now told Git to track those two files.</p>   <p>In fact, as you did that, if you now look into your object directory, you’ll notice that Git will have added two new objects to the object database. If you did exactly the steps above, you should now be able to do</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ ls .git/objects/??/*</pre> </div> </div>  <p>and see two files:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>.git/objects/55/7db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238
.git/objects/f2/4c74a2e500f5ee1332c86b94199f52b1d1d962</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which correspond with the objects with names of <span class="synopsis"><code>557db...</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>f24c7...</code></span> respectively.</p>   <p>If you want to, you can use <code>git cat-file</code> to look at those objects, but you’ll have to use the object name, not the filename of the object:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git cat-file -t 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238</pre> </div> </div>  <p>where the <span class="synopsis"><code>-t</code></span> tells <code>git cat-file</code> to tell you what the "type" of the object is. Git will tell you that you have a "blob" object (i.e., just a regular file), and you can see the contents with</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git cat-file blob 557db03</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which will print out "Hello World". The object <span class="synopsis"><code>557db03</code></span> is nothing more than the contents of your file <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span>.</p>  <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <div class="title">Note</div> </td> <td class="content"> Don’t confuse that object with the file <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span> itself. The object is literally just those specific <strong>contents</strong> of the file, and however much you later change the contents in file <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span>, the object we just looked at will never change. Objects are immutable. </td> </tr> </table> </div> <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <div class="title">Note</div> </td> <td class="content"> The second example demonstrates that you can abbreviate the object name to only the first several hexadecimal digits in most places. </td> </tr> </table> </div>  <p>Anyway, as we mentioned previously, you normally never actually take a look at the objects themselves, and typing long 40-character hex names is not something you’d normally want to do. The above digression was just to show that <code>git update-index</code> did something magical, and actually saved away the contents of your files into the Git object database.</p>   <p>Updating the index did something else too: it created a <span class="synopsis"><code>.git/index</code></span> file. This is the index that describes your current working tree, and something you should be very aware of. Again, you normally never worry about the index file itself, but you should be aware of the fact that you have not actually really "checked in" your files into Git so far, you’ve only <strong>told</strong> Git about them.</p>   <p>However, since Git knows about them, you can now start using some of the most basic Git commands to manipulate the files or look at their status.</p>   <p>In particular, let’s not even check in the two files into Git yet, we’ll start off by adding another line to <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span> first:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ echo "It's a new day for git" &gt;&gt;hello</pre> </div> </div>  <p>and you can now, since you told Git about the previous state of <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span>, ask Git what has changed in the tree compared to your old index, using the <code>git diff-files</code> command:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git diff-files</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Oops. That wasn’t very readable. It just spit out its own internal version of a <code>diff</code>, but that internal version really just tells you that it has noticed that "hello" has been modified, and that the old object contents it had have been replaced with something else.</p>   <p>To make it readable, we can tell <code>git diff-files</code> to output the differences as a patch, using the <span class="synopsis"><code>-p</code></span> flag:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git diff-files -p

 Hello World
+It's a new day for git</pre> </div> </div> </div>   <h2 id="_committing_git_state">Committing git state</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Now, we want to go to the next stage in Git, which is to take the files that Git knows about in the index, and commit them as a real tree. We do that in two phases: creating a <code>tree</code> object, and committing that <code>tree</code> object as a <code>commit</code> object together with an explanation of what the tree was all about, along with information of how we came to that state.</p>   <p>Creating a tree object is trivial, and is done with <code>git write-tree</code>. There are no options or other input: <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>write-tree</code></span> will take the current index state, and write an object that describes that whole index. In other words, we’re now tying together all the different filenames with their contents (and their permissions), and we’re creating the equivalent of a Git "directory" object:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git write-tree</pre> </div> </div>  <p>and this will just output the name of the resulting tree, in this case (if you have done exactly as I’ve described) it should be</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>8988da15d077d4829fc51d8544c097def6644dbb</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which is another incomprehensible object name. Again, if you want to, you can use <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>cat-file</code> <code>-t</code> <code>8988d...</code></span> to see that this time the object is not a "blob" object, but a "tree" object (you can also use <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>cat-file</code></span> to actually output the raw object contents, but you’ll see mainly a binary mess, so that’s less interesting).</p>   <p>However — normally you’d never use <code>git write-tree</code> on its own, because normally you always commit a tree into a commit object using the <code>git commit-tree</code> command. In fact, it’s easier to not actually use <code>git write-tree</code> on its own at all, but to just pass its result in as an argument to <code>git commit-tree</code>.</p>   <p><code>git commit-tree</code> normally takes several arguments — it wants to know what the <code>parent</code> of a commit was, but since this is the first commit ever in this new repository, and it has no parents, we only need to pass in the object name of the tree. However, <code>git commit-tree</code> also wants to get a commit message on its standard input, and it will write out the resulting object name for the commit to its standard output.</p>   <p>And this is where we create the <span class="synopsis"><code>.git/refs/heads/master</code></span> file which is pointed at by <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD</code></span>. This file is supposed to contain the reference to the top-of-tree of the master branch, and since that’s exactly what <code>git commit-tree</code> spits out, we can do this all with a sequence of simple shell commands:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ tree=$(git write-tree)
$ commit=$(echo 'Initial commit' | git commit-tree $tree)
$ git update-ref HEAD $commit</pre> </div> </div>  <p>In this case this creates a totally new commit that is not related to anything else. Normally you do this only <strong>once</strong> for a project ever, and all later commits will be parented on top of an earlier commit.</p>   <p>Again, normally you’d never actually do this by hand. There is a helpful script called <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>commit</code></span> that will do all of this for you. So you could have just written <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>commit</code></span> instead, and it would have done the above magic scripting for you.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_making_a_change">Making a change</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Remember how we did the <code>git update-index</code> on file <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span> and then we changed <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span> afterward, and could compare the new state of <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span> with the state we saved in the index file?</p>   <p>Further, remember how I said that <code>git write-tree</code> writes the contents of the <strong>index</strong> file to the tree, and thus what we just committed was in fact the <strong>original</strong> contents of the file <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span>, not the new ones. We did that on purpose, to show the difference between the index state, and the state in the working tree, and how they don’t have to match, even when we commit things.</p>   <p>As before, if we do <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>diff-files</code> <code>-p</code></span> in our git-tutorial project, we’ll still see the same difference we saw last time: the index file hasn’t changed by the act of committing anything. However, now that we have committed something, we can also learn to use a new command: <code>git diff-index</code>.</p>   <p>Unlike <code>git diff-files</code>, which showed the difference between the index file and the working tree, <code>git diff-index</code> shows the differences between a committed <strong>tree</strong> and either the index file or the working tree. In other words, <code>git diff-index</code> wants a tree to be diffed against, and before we did the commit, we couldn’t do that, because we didn’t have anything to diff against.</p>   <p>But now we can do</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git diff-index -p HEAD</pre> </div> </div>  <p>(where <span class="synopsis"><code>-p</code></span> has the same meaning as it did in <code>git diff-files</code>), and it will show us the same difference, but for a totally different reason. Now we’re comparing the working tree not against the index file, but against the tree we just wrote. It just so happens that those two are obviously the same, so we get the same result.</p>   <p>Again, because this is a common operation, you can also just shorthand it with</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git diff HEAD</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which ends up doing the above for you.</p>   <p>In other words, <code>git diff-index</code> normally compares a tree against the working tree, but when given the <span class="synopsis"><code>--cached</code></span> flag, it is told to instead compare against just the index cache contents, and ignore the current working tree state entirely. Since we just wrote the index file to HEAD, doing <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>diff-index</code> <code>--cached</code> <code>-p</code> <code>HEAD</code></span> should thus return an empty set of differences, and that’s exactly what it does.</p>  <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <div class="title">Note</div> </td> <td class="content">  <p><code>git diff-index</code> really always uses the index for its comparisons, and saying that it compares a tree against the working tree is thus not strictly accurate. In particular, the list of files to compare (the "meta-data") <strong>always</strong> comes from the index file, regardless of whether the <span class="synopsis"><code>--cached</code></span> flag is used or not. The <span class="synopsis"><code>--cached</code></span> flag really only determines whether the file <strong>contents</strong> to be compared come from the working tree or not.</p>   <p>This is not hard to understand, as soon as you realize that Git simply never knows (or cares) about files that it is not told about explicitly. Git will never go <strong>looking</strong> for files to compare, it expects you to tell it what the files are, and that’s what the index is there for.</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </div>  <p>However, our next step is to commit the <strong>change</strong> we did, and again, to understand what’s going on, keep in mind the difference between "working tree contents", "index file" and "committed tree". We have changes in the working tree that we want to commit, and we always have to work through the index file, so the first thing we need to do is to update the index cache:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git update-index hello</pre> </div> </div>  <p>(note how we didn’t need the <span class="synopsis"><code>--add</code></span> flag this time, since Git knew about the file already).</p>   <p>Note what happens to the different <code>git diff-*</code> versions here. After we’ve updated <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span> in the index, <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>diff-files</code> <code>-p</code></span> now shows no differences, but <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>diff-index</code> <code>-p</code> <code>HEAD</code></span> still <strong>does</strong> show that the current state is different from the state we committed. In fact, now <code>git diff-index</code> shows the same difference whether we use the <span class="synopsis"><code>--cached</code></span> flag or not, since now the index is coherent with the working tree.</p>   <p>Now, since we’ve updated <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span> in the index, we can commit the new version. We could do it by writing the tree by hand again, and committing the tree (this time we’d have to use the <span class="synopsis"><code>-p</code> <code>HEAD</code></span> flag to tell commit that the HEAD was the <strong>parent</strong> of the new commit, and that this wasn’t an initial commit any more), but you’ve done that once already, so let’s just use the helpful script this time:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git commit</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which starts an editor for you to write the commit message and tells you a bit about what you have done.</p>   <p>Write whatever message you want, and all the lines that start with <code>#</code> will be pruned out, and the rest will be used as the commit message for the change. If you decide you don’t want to commit anything after all at this point (you can continue to edit things and update the index), you can just leave an empty message. Otherwise <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>commit</code></span> will commit the change for you.</p>   <p>You’ve now made your first real Git commit. And if you’re interested in looking at what <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>commit</code></span> really does, feel free to investigate: it’s a few very simple shell scripts to generate the helpful (?) commit message headers, and a few one-liners that actually do the commit itself (<code>git commit</code>).</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_inspecting_changes">Inspecting changes</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>While creating changes is useful, it’s even more useful if you can tell later what changed. The most useful command for this is another of the <code>diff</code> family, namely <code>git diff-tree</code>.</p>   <p><code>git diff-tree</code> can be given two arbitrary trees, and it will tell you the differences between them. Perhaps even more commonly, though, you can give it just a single commit object, and it will figure out the parent of that commit itself, and show the difference directly. Thus, to get the same diff that we’ve already seen several times, we can now do</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git diff-tree -p HEAD</pre> </div> </div>  <p>(again, <span class="synopsis"><code>-p</code></span> means to show the difference as a human-readable patch), and it will show what the last commit (in <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD</code></span>) actually changed.</p>  <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <div class="title">Note</div> </td> <td class="content">  <p>Here is an ASCII art by Jon Loeliger that illustrates how various <code>diff-*</code> commands compare things.</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>            diff-tree

You can, for example, do</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git diff my-first-tag</pre> </div> </div>  <p>to diff your current state against that tag which at this point will obviously be an empty diff, but if you continue to develop and commit stuff, you can use your tag as an "anchor-point" to see what has changed since you tagged it.</p>   <p>An "annotated tag" is actually a real Git object, and contains not only a pointer to the state you want to tag, but also a small tag name and message, along with optionally a PGP signature that says that yes, you really did that tag. You create these annotated tags with either the <span class="synopsis"><code>-a</code></span> or <span class="synopsis"><code>-s</code></span> flag to <code>git tag</code>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git tag -s &lt;tagname&gt;</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which will sign the current <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD</code></span> (but you can also give it another argument that specifies the thing to tag, e.g., you could have tagged the current <span class="synopsis"><code>mybranch</code></span> point by using <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>tag</code> <em>&lt;tagname&gt;</em> <code>mybranch</code></span>).</p>   <p>You normally only do signed tags for major releases or things like that, while the light-weight tags are useful for any marking you want to do — any time you decide that you want to remember a certain point, just create a private tag for it, and you have a nice symbolic name for the state at that point.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_copying_repositories">Copying repositories</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Git repositories are normally totally self-sufficient and relocatable. Unlike CVS, for example, there is no separate notion of "repository" and "working tree".

What you see is what you got.</p>  <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <div class="title">Note</div> </td> <td class="content"> You can tell Git to split the Git internal information from the directory that it tracks, but we’ll ignore that for now: it’s not how normal projects work, and it’s really only meant for special uses.

There’s no external repository, and there’s no history outside the project you created.</p>  </li> <li> <p>if you want to move or duplicate a Git repository, you can do so. There is <code>git clone</code> command, but if all you want to do is just to create a copy of your repository (with all the full history that went along with it), you can do so with a regular <span class="synopsis"><code>cp</code> <code>-a</code> <code>git-tutorial</code> <code>new-git-tutorial</code></span>.</p>  <p>Note that when you’ve moved or copied a Git repository, your Git index file (which caches various information, notably some of the "stat" information for the files involved) will likely need to be refreshed. So after you do a <span class="synopsis"><code>cp</code> <code>-a</code></span> to create a new copy, you’ll want to do</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git update-index --refresh</pre> </div> </div>  <p>in the new repository to make sure that the index file is up to date.</p>  </li> </ul> </div>  <p>Note that the second point is true even across machines. You can duplicate a remote Git repository with <strong>any</strong> regular copy mechanism, be it <code>scp</code>, <code>rsync</code> or <code>wget</code>.</p>   <p>When copying a remote repository, you’ll want to at a minimum update the index cache when you do this, and especially with other peoples' repositories you often want to make sure that the index cache is in some known state (you don’t know <strong>what</strong> they’ve done and not yet checked in), so usually you’ll precede the <code>git update-index</code> with a</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git read-tree --reset HEAD
$ git update-index --refresh</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which will force a total index re-build from the tree pointed to by <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD</code></span>. It resets the index contents to <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD</code></span>, and then the <code>git update-index</code> makes sure to match up all index entries with the checked-out files. If the original repository had uncommitted changes in its working tree, <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>update-index</code> <code>--refresh</code></span> notices them and tells you they need to be updated.</p>   <p>The above can also be written as simply</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git reset</pre> </div> </div>  <p>and in fact a lot of the common Git command combinations can be scripted with the <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>xyz</code></span> interfaces. You can learn things by just looking at what the various git scripts do. For example, <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>reset</code></span> used to be the above two lines implemented in <code>git reset</code>, but some things like <code>git status</code> and <code>git commit</code> are slightly more complex scripts around the basic Git commands.</p>   <p>Many (most?) public remote repositories will not contain any of the checked out files or even an index file, and will <strong>only</strong> contain the actual core Git files. Such a repository usually doesn’t even have the <span class="synopsis"><code>.git</code></span> subdirectory, but has all the Git files directly in the repository.</p>   <p>To create your own local live copy of such a "raw" Git repository, you’d first create your own subdirectory for the project, and then copy the raw repository contents into the <span class="synopsis"><code>.git</code></span> directory. For example, to create your own copy of the Git repository, you’d do the following</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ mkdir my-git
$ cd my-git
$ rsync -rL rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/ .git</pre> </div> </div>  <p>followed by</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git read-tree HEAD</pre> </div> </div>  <p>to populate the index. However, now you have populated the index, and you have all the Git internal files, but you will notice that you don’t actually have any of the working tree files to work on. To get those, you’d check them out with</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git checkout-index -u -a</pre> </div> </div>  <p>where the <span class="synopsis"><code>-u</code></span> flag means that you want the checkout to keep the index up to date (so that you don’t have to refresh it afterward), and the <span class="synopsis"><code>-a</code></span> flag means "check out all files" (if you have a stale copy or an older version of a checked out tree you may also need to add the <span class="synopsis"><code>-f</code></span> flag first, to tell <code>git checkout-index</code> to <strong>force</strong> overwriting of any old files).</p>   <p>Again, this can all be simplified with</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/ my-git
$ cd my-git
$ git checkout</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which will end up doing all of the above for you.</p>   <p>You have now successfully copied somebody else’s (mine) remote repository, and checked it out.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_creating_a_new_branch">Creating a new branch</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Branches in Git are really nothing more than pointers into the Git object database from within the <span class="synopsis"><code>.git/refs/</code></span> subdirectory, and as we already discussed, the <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD</code></span> branch is nothing but a symlink to one of these object pointers.</p>   <p>You can at any time create a new branch by just picking an arbitrary point in the project history, and just writing the SHA-1 name of that object into a file under <span class="synopsis"><code>.git/refs/heads/</code></span>.

That’s just a convention, though, and nothing enforces it.</p>   <p>To show that as an example, let’s go back to the git-tutorial repository we used earlier, and create a branch in it.

So assuming you created the above <span class="synopsis"><code>mybranch</code></span> that started out being the same as the original <span class="synopsis"><code>master</code></span> branch, let’s make sure we’re in that branch, and do some work there.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git switch mybranch
$ echo "Work, work, work" &gt;&gt;hello
$ git commit -m "Some work." -i hello</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Here, we just added another line to <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span>, and we used a shorthand for doing both <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>update-index</code> <code>hello</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>commit</code></span> by just giving the filename directly to <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>commit</code></span>, with an <span class="synopsis"><code>-i</code></span> flag (it tells Git to <code>include</code> that file in addition to what you have done to the index file so far when making the commit). The <span class="synopsis"><code>-m</code></span> flag is to give the commit log message from the command line.</p>   <p>Now, to make it a bit more interesting, let’s assume that somebody else does some work in the original branch, and simulate that by going back to the master branch, and editing the same file differently there:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git switch master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Here, take a moment to look at the contents of <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span>, and notice how they don’t contain the work we just did in <span class="synopsis"><code>mybranch</code></span> — because that work hasn’t happened in the <span class="synopsis"><code>master</code></span> branch at all. Then do</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ echo "Play, play, play" &gt;&gt;hello
$ echo "Lots of fun" &gt;&gt;example
$ git commit -m "Some fun." -i hello example</pre> </div> </div>  <p>since the master branch is obviously in a much better mood.</p>   <p>Now, you’ve got two branches, and you decide that you want to merge the work done. Before we do that, let’s introduce a cool graphical tool that helps you view what’s going on:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ gitk --all</pre> </div> </div>  <p>will show you graphically both of your branches (that’s what the <span class="synopsis"><code>--all</code></span> means: normally it will just show you your current <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD</code></span>) and their histories. You can also see exactly how they came to be from a common source.</p>   <p>Anyway, let’s exit <code>gitk</code> (<span class="synopsis"><code>^Q</code></span> or the File menu), and decide that we want to merge the work we did on the <span class="synopsis"><code>mybranch</code></span> branch into the <span class="synopsis"><code>master</code></span> branch (which is currently our <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD</code></span> too). To do that, there’s a nice script called <code>git merge</code>, which wants to know which branches you want to resolve and what the merge is all about:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git merge -m "Merge work in mybranch" mybranch</pre> </div> </div>  <p>where the first argument is going to be used as the commit message if the merge can be resolved automatically.</p>   <p>Now, in this case we’ve intentionally created a situation where the merge will need to be fixed up by hand, though, so Git will do as much of it as it can automatically (which in this case is just merge the <span class="synopsis"><code>example</code></span> file, which had no differences in the <span class="synopsis"><code>mybranch</code></span> branch), and say:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>        Auto-merging hello
        CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello
        Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</pre> </div> </div>  <p>It tells you that it did an "Automatic merge", which failed due to conflicts in <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span>.</p>   <p>Not to worry. It left the (trivial) conflict in <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span> in the same form you should already be well used to if you’ve ever used CVS, so let’s just open <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span> in our editor (whatever that may be), and fix it up somehow. I’d suggest just making it so that <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span> contains all four lines:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>Hello World
It's a new day for git
Play, play, play
Work, work, work</pre> </div> </div>  <p>and once you’re happy with your manual merge, just do a</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git commit -i hello</pre> </div> </div>  <p>which will very loudly warn you that you’re now committing a merge (which is correct, so never mind), and you can write a small merge message about your adventures in <code>git merge</code>-land.</p>   <p>After you’re done, start up <span class="synopsis"><code>gitk</code> <code>--all</code></span> to see graphically what the history looks like. Notice that <span class="synopsis"><code>mybranch</code></span> still exists, and you can switch to it, and continue to work with it if you want to. The <span class="synopsis"><code>mybranch</code></span> branch will not contain the merge, but next time you merge it from the <span class="synopsis"><code>master</code></span> branch, Git will know how you merged it, so you’ll not have to do <code>that</code> merge again.</p>   <p>Another useful tool, especially if you do not always work in X-Window environment, is <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>show-branch</code></span>.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git show-branch --topo-order --more=1 master mybranch

Three commits are shown along with their titles. All of them have non blank characters in the first column (<span class="synopsis"><code>*</code></span> shows an ordinary commit on the current branch, <span class="synopsis"><code>-</code></span> is a merge commit), which means they are now part of the <span class="synopsis"><code>master</code></span> branch. Only the "Some work" commit has the plus <span class="synopsis"><code>+</code></span> character in the second column, because <span class="synopsis"><code>mybranch</code></span> has not been merged to incorporate these commits from the master branch. The string inside brackets before the commit log message is a short name you can use to name the commit.

First, it finds the common ancestor between them. The command it uses is <code>git merge-base</code>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ mb=$(git merge-base HEAD mybranch)</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The command writes the commit object name of the common ancestor to the standard output, so we captured its output to a variable, because we will be using it in the next step. By the way, the common ancestor commit is the "Initial commit" commit in this case. You can tell it by:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git name-rev --name-only --tags $mb
my-first-tag</pre> </div> </div>  <p>After finding out a common ancestor commit, the second step is this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git read-tree -m -u $mb HEAD mybranch</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This is the same <code>git read-tree</code> command we have already seen, but it takes three trees, unlike previous examples. This reads the contents of each tree into different <code>stage</code> in the index file (the first tree goes to stage 1, the second to stage 2, etc.). After reading three trees into three stages, the paths that are the same in all three stages are <code>collapsed</code> into stage 0. Also paths that are the same in two of three stages are collapsed into stage 0, taking the SHA-1 from either stage 2 or stage 3, whichever is different from stage 1 (i.e. only one side changed from the common ancestor).</p>   <p>After <code>collapsing</code> operation, paths that are different in three trees are left in non-zero stages. At this point, you can inspect the index file with this command:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git ls-files --stage

But in real-life large projects, when only a small number of files change in one commit, this <code>collapsing</code> tends to trivially merge most of the paths fairly quickly, leaving only a handful of real changes in non-zero stages.</p>   <p>To look at only non-zero stages, use <span class="synopsis"><code>--unmerged</code></span> flag:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git ls-files --unmerged

This is done by giving <code>git merge-one-file</code> command as one of the arguments to <code>git merge-index</code> command:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git merge-index git-merge-one-file hello
Auto-merging hello
ERROR: Merge conflict in hello
fatal: merge program failed</pre> </div> </div>  <p><code>git merge-one-file</code> script is called with parameters to describe those three versions, and is responsible to leave the merge results in the working tree. It is a fairly straightforward shell script, and eventually calls <code>merge</code> program from RCS suite to perform a file-level 3-way merge. In this case, <code>merge</code> detects conflicts, and the merge result with conflict marks is left in the working tree.. This can be seen if you run <span class="synopsis"><code>ls-files</code> <code>--stage</code></span> again at this point:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git ls-files --stage

Notice that the path <span class="synopsis"><code>hello</code></span> is still unmerged, and what you see with <code>git diff</code> at this point is differences since stage 2 (i.e. your version).</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_publishing_your_work">Publishing your work</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>So, we can use somebody else’s work from a remote repository, but how can <strong>you</strong> prepare a repository to let other people pull from it?</p>   <p>You do your real work in your working tree that has your primary repository hanging under it as its <span class="synopsis"><code>.git</code></span> subdirectory.

The idea is the same if there are more than two branches. Let’s say you started out from "master" head, and have some new code in the "master" branch, and two independent fixes in the "commit-fix" and "diff-fix" branches:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git show-branch

  * [master] Release candidate #1
++* [diff-fix~2] Pretty-print messages.</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Both fixes are tested well, and at this point, you want to merge in both of them. You could merge in <code>diff-fix</code> first and then <code>commit-fix</code> next, like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git merge -m "Merge fix in diff-fix" diff-fix
$ git merge -m "Merge fix in commit-fix" commit-fix</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Which would result in:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git show-branch

  * [master~2] Release candidate #1
++* [master~3] Pretty-print messages.</pre> </div> </div>  <p>However, there is no particular reason to merge in one branch first and the other next, when what you have are a set of truly independent changes (if the order mattered, then they are not independent by definition). You could instead merge those two branches into the current branch at once. First let’s undo what we just did and start over. We would want to get the master branch before these two merges by resetting it to <code>master~2</code>:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git reset --hard master~2</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You can make sure <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>show-branch</code></span> matches the state before those two <code>git merge</code> you just did. Then, instead of running two <code>git merge</code> commands in a row, you would merge these two branch heads (this is known as <code>making an Octopus</code>):</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git merge commit-fix diff-fix

  * [master~1] Release candidate #1
++* [master~2] Pretty-print messages.</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Note that you should not do Octopus just because you can. An octopus is a valid thing to do and often makes it easier to view the commit history if you are merging more than two independent changes at the same time. However, if you have merge conflicts with any of the branches you are merging in and need to hand resolve, that is an indication that the development happened in those branches were not independent after all, and you should merge two at a time, documenting how you resolved the conflicts, and the reason why you preferred changes made in one side over the other. Otherwise it would make the project history harder to follow, not easier.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_see_also">See also</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p><a href="gittutorial">gittutorial[7]</a>, <a href="gittutorial-2">gittutorial-2[7]</a>, <a href="gitcvs-migration">gitcvs-migration[7]</a>, <a href="git-help">git-help[1]</a>, <a href="giteveryday">giteveryday[7]</a>, <a href="user-manual">The Git User’s Manual</a></p>  </div>      <h3 hidden="true" data-pagefind-weight="7">gitcore-tutorial</h3><div class="_attribution">
