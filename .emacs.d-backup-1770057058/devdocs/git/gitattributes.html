End-of-line conversion</h4>  <p>While Git normally leaves file contents alone, it can be configured to normalize line endings to LF in the repository and, optionally, to convert them to CRLF when files are checked out.</p>   <p>If you simply want to have CRLF line endings in your working directory regardless of the repository you are working with, you can set the config variable "core.autocrlf" without using any attributes.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[core]

<span class="synopsis"><code>working-tree-encoding</code></span>
</h4>  <p>Git recognizes files encoded in ASCII or one of its supersets (e.g. UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, …​) as text files. Files encoded in certain other encodings (e.g. UTF-16) are interpreted as binary and consequently built-in Git text processing tools (e.g. <code>git diff</code>) as well as most Git web front ends do not visualize the contents of these files by default.</p>   <p>In these cases you can tell Git the encoding of a file in the working directory with the <span class="synopsis"><code>working-tree-encoding</code></span> attribute. If a file with this attribute is added to Git, then Git re-encodes the content from the specified encoding to UTF-8. Finally, Git stores the UTF-8 encoded content in its internal data structure (called "the index"). On checkout the content is re-encoded back to the specified encoding.</p>   <p>Please note that using the <span class="synopsis"><code>working-tree-encoding</code></span> attribute may have a number of pitfalls:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Alternative Git implementations (e.g. JGit or libgit2) and older Git versions (as of March 2018) do not support the <span class="synopsis"><code>working-tree-encoding</code></span> attribute. If you decide to use the <span class="synopsis"><code>working-tree-encoding</code></span> attribute in your repository, then it is strongly recommended to ensure that all clients working with the repository support it.</p>  <p>For example, Microsoft Visual Studio resources files (<span class="synopsis"><code>*.rc</code></span>) or PowerShell script files (<span class="synopsis"><code>*.ps1</code></span>) are sometimes encoded in UTF-16. If you declare <span class="synopsis"><code>*.ps1</code></span> as files as UTF-16 and you add <span class="synopsis"><code>foo.ps1</code></span> with a <span class="synopsis"><code>working-tree-encoding</code></span> enabled Git client, then <span class="synopsis"><code>foo.ps1</code></span> will be stored as UTF-8 internally. A client without <span class="synopsis"><code>working-tree-encoding</code></span> support will checkout <span class="synopsis"><code>foo.ps1</code></span> as UTF-8 encoded file. This will typically cause trouble for the users of this file.</p>   <p>If a Git client that does not support the <span class="synopsis"><code>working-tree-encoding</code></span> attribute adds a new file <span class="synopsis"><code>bar.ps1</code></span>, then <span class="synopsis"><code>bar.ps1</code></span> will be stored "as-is" internally (in this example probably as UTF-16). A client with <span class="synopsis"><code>working-tree-encoding</code></span> support will interpret the internal contents as UTF-8 and try to convert it to UTF-16 on checkout. That operation will fail and cause an error.</p>  </li> <li> <p>Reencoding content to non-UTF encodings can cause errors as the conversion might not be UTF-8 round trip safe. If you suspect your encoding to not be round trip safe, then add it to <span class="synopsis"><code>core.checkRoundtripEncoding</code></span> to make Git check the round trip encoding (see <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a>). SHIFT-JIS (Japanese character set) is known to have round trip issues with UTF-8 and is checked by default.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reencoding content requires resources that might slow down certain Git operations (e.g <code>git checkout</code> or <code>git add</code>).</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>Use the <span class="synopsis"><code>working-tree-encoding</code></span> attribute only if you cannot store a file in UTF-8 encoding and if you want Git to be able to process the content as text.</p>   <p>As an example, use the following attributes if your <code>*.ps1</code> files are UTF-16 encoded with byte order mark (BOM) and you want Git to perform automatic line ending conversion based on your platform.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>*.ps1                text working-tree-encoding=UTF-16</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Use the following attributes if your <code>*.ps1</code> files are UTF-16 little endian encoded without BOM and you want Git to use Windows line endings in the working directory (use <span class="synopsis"><code>UTF-16LE-BOM</code></span> instead of <span class="synopsis"><code>UTF-16LE</code></span> if you want UTF-16 little endian with BOM). Please note, it is highly recommended to explicitly define the line endings with <span class="synopsis"><code>eol</code></span> if the <span class="synopsis"><code>working-tree-encoding</code></span> attribute is used to avoid ambiguity.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>*.ps1                text working-tree-encoding=UTF-16LE eol=crlf</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You can get a list of all available encodings on your platform with the following command:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>iconv --list</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If you do not know the encoding of a file, then you can use the <span class="synopsis"><code>file</code></span> command to guess the encoding:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>file foo.ps1</pre> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_ident">
<span class="synopsis"><code>ident</code></span>
</h4>  <p>When the attribute <span class="synopsis"><code>ident</code></span> is set for a path, Git replaces <span class="synopsis"><code>$Id$</code></span> in the blob object with <span class="synopsis"><code>$Id:</code></span>, followed by the 40-character hexadecimal blob object name, followed by a dollar sign <span class="synopsis"><code>$</code></span> upon checkout. Any byte sequence that begins with <span class="synopsis"><code>$Id:</code></span> and ends with <span class="synopsis"><code>$</code></span> in the worktree file is replaced with <span class="synopsis"><code>$Id$</code></span> upon check-in.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_filter">
<span class="synopsis"><code>filter</code></span>
</h4>  <p>A <span class="synopsis"><code>filter</code></span> attribute can be set to a string value that names a filter driver specified in the configuration.</p>   <p>A filter driver consists of a <span class="synopsis"><code>clean</code></span> command and a <span class="synopsis"><code>smudge</code></span> command, either of which can be left unspecified. Upon checkout, when the <span class="synopsis"><code>smudge</code></span> command is specified, the command is fed the blob object from its standard input, and its standard output is used to update the worktree file. Similarly, the <span class="synopsis"><code>clean</code></span> command is used to convert the contents of worktree file upon checkin. By default these commands process only a single blob and terminate. If a long running <span class="synopsis"><code>process</code></span> filter is used in place of <span class="synopsis"><code>clean</code></span> and/or <span class="synopsis"><code>smudge</code></span> filters, then Git can process all blobs with a single filter command invocation for the entire life of a single Git command, for example <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>add</code> <code>--all</code></span>. If a long running <span class="synopsis"><code>process</code></span> filter is configured then it always takes precedence over a configured single blob filter. See section below for the description of the protocol used to communicate with a <span class="synopsis"><code>process</code></span> filter.</p>   <p>One use of the content filtering is to massage the content into a shape that is more convenient for the platform, filesystem, and the user to use. For this mode of operation, the key phrase here is "more convenient" and not "turning something unusable into usable". In other words, the intent is that if someone unsets the filter driver definition, or does not have the appropriate filter program, the project should still be usable.</p>   <p>Another use of the content filtering is to store the content that cannot be directly used in the repository (e.g. a UUID that refers to the true content stored outside Git, or an encrypted content) and turn it into a usable form upon checkout (e.g. download the external content, or decrypt the encrypted content).</p>   <p>These two filters behave differently, and by default, a filter is taken as the former, massaging the contents into more convenient shape. A missing filter driver definition in the config, or a filter driver that exits with a non-zero status, is not an error but makes the filter a no-op passthru.</p>   <p>You can declare that a filter turns a content that by itself is unusable into a usable content by setting the filter.&lt;driver&gt;.required configuration variable to <span class="synopsis"><code>true</code></span>.</p>   <p>Note: Whenever the clean filter is changed, the repo should be renormalized: $ git add --renormalize .</p>   <p>For example, in .gitattributes, you would assign the <span class="synopsis"><code>filter</code></span> attribute for paths.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>*.c        filter=indent</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Then you would define a "filter.indent.clean" and "filter.indent.smudge" configuration in your .git/config to specify a pair of commands to modify the contents of C programs when the source files are checked in ("clean" is run) and checked out (no change is made because the command is "cat").</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[filter "indent"]
        clean = indent
        smudge = cat</pre> </div> </div>  <p>For best results, <span class="synopsis"><code>clean</code></span> should not alter its output further if it is run twice ("clean→clean" should be equivalent to "clean"), and multiple <span class="synopsis"><code>smudge</code></span> commands should not alter <span class="synopsis"><code>clean</code></span>'s output ("smudge→smudge→clean" should be equivalent to "clean"). See the section on merging below.</p>   <p>The "indent" filter is well-behaved in this regard: it will not modify input that is already correctly indented. In this case, the lack of a smudge filter means that the clean filter <code>must</code> accept its own output without modifying it.</p>   <p>If a filter <code>must</code> succeed in order to make the stored contents usable, you can declare that the filter is <span class="synopsis"><code>required</code></span>, in the configuration:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[filter "crypt"]
        clean = openssl enc ...
        smudge = openssl enc -d ...
        required</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Sequence "%f" on the filter command line is replaced with the name of the file the filter is working on. A filter might use this in keyword substitution. For example:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[filter "p4"]
        clean = git-p4-filter --clean %f
        smudge = git-p4-filter --smudge %f</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Note that "%f" is the name of the path that is being worked on. Depending on the version that is being filtered, the corresponding file on disk may not exist, or may have different contents. So, smudge and clean commands should not try to access the file on disk, but only act as filters on the content provided to them on standard input.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_long_running_filter_process">
Long Running Filter Process</h4>  <p>If the filter command (a string value) is defined via <span class="synopsis"><code>filter.</code><em>&lt;driver&gt;</em><code>.process</code></span> then Git can process all blobs with a single filter invocation for the entire life of a single Git command. This is achieved by using the long-running process protocol (described in Documentation/technical/long-running-process-protocol.adoc).</p>   <p>When Git encounters the first file that needs to be cleaned or smudged, it starts the filter and performs the handshake. In the handshake, the welcome message sent by Git is "git-filter-client", only version 2 is supported, and the supported capabilities are "clean", "smudge", and "delay".</p>   <p>Afterwards Git sends a list of "key=value" pairs terminated with a flush packet. The list will contain at least the filter command (based on the supported capabilities) and the pathname of the file to filter relative to the repository root. Right after the flush packet Git sends the content split in zero or more pkt-line packets and a flush packet to terminate content. Please note, that the filter must not send any response before it received the content and the final flush packet.

Right after these packets the filter is expected to send the content in zero or more pkt-line packets and a flush packet at the end. Finally, a second list of "key=value" pairs terminated with a flush packet is expected. The filter can change the status in the second list or keep the status as is with an empty list.

Performing text diffs of binary files</h4>  <p>Sometimes it is desirable to see the diff of a text-converted version of some binary files. For example, a word processor document can be converted to an ASCII text representation, and the diff of the text shown. Even though this conversion loses some information, the resulting diff is useful for human viewing (but cannot be applied directly).</p>   <p>The <span class="synopsis"><code>textconv</code></span> config option is used to define a program for performing such a conversion. The program should take a single argument, the name of a file to convert, and produce the resulting text on stdout.</p>   <p>For example, to show the diff of the exif information of a file instead of the binary information (assuming you have the exif tool installed), add the following section to your <span class="synopsis"><code>$GIT_DIR/config</code></span> file (or <span class="synopsis"><code>$HOME/.gitconfig</code></span> file):</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[diff "jpg"]
        textconv = exif</pre> </div> </div> <div class="admonitionblock note"> <table> <tr> <td class="icon"> <div class="title">Note</div> </td> <td class="content"> The text conversion is generally a one-way conversion; in this example, we lose the actual image contents and focus just on the text data. This means that diffs generated by textconv are <em>not</em> suitable for applying. For this reason, only <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>diff</code></span> and the <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>log</code></span> family of commands (i.e., log, whatchanged, show) will perform text conversion. <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>format-patch</code></span> will never generate this output. If you want to send somebody a text-converted diff of a binary file (e.g., because it quickly conveys the changes you have made), you should generate it separately and send it as a comment <em>in addition to</em> the usual binary diff that you might send. </td> </tr> </table> </div>  <p>Because text conversion can be slow, especially when doing a large number of them with <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>log</code> <code>-p</code></span>, Git provides a mechanism to cache the output and use it in future diffs. To enable caching, set the "cachetextconv" variable in your diff driver’s config. For example:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[diff "jpg"]
        textconv = exif
        cachetextconv = true</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This will cache the result of running "exif" on each blob indefinitely. If you change the textconv config variable for a diff driver, Git will automatically invalidate the cache entries and re-run the textconv filter. If you want to invalidate the cache manually (e.g., because your version of "exif" was updated and now produces better output), you can remove the cache manually with <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>update-ref</code> <code>-d</code> <code>refs/notes/textconv/jpg</code></span> (where "jpg" is the name of the diff driver, as in the example above).</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_choosing_textconv_versus_external_diff">
Choosing textconv versus external diff</h4>  <p>If you want to show differences between binary or specially-formatted blobs in your repository, you can choose to use either an external diff command, or to use textconv to convert them to a diff-able text format. Which method you choose depends on your exact situation.</p>   <p>The advantage of using an external diff command is flexibility. You are not bound to find line-oriented changes, nor is it necessary for the output to resemble unified diff. You are free to locate and report changes in the most appropriate way for your data format.</p>   <p>A textconv, by comparison, is much more limiting. You provide a transformation of the data into a line-oriented text format, and Git uses its regular diff tools to generate the output. There are several advantages to choosing this method:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>Ease of use. It is often much simpler to write a binary to text transformation than it is to perform your own diff. In many cases, existing programs can be used as textconv filters (e.g., exif, odt2txt).</p> </li> <li> <p>Git diff features. By performing only the transformation step yourself, you can still utilize many of Git’s diff features, including colorization, word-diff, and combined diffs for merges.</p> </li> <li> <p>Caching. Textconv caching can speed up repeated diffs, such as those you might trigger by running <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>log</code> <code>-p</code></span>.</p> </li> </ol> </div> </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_marking_files_as_binary">
Marking files as binary</h4>  <p>Git usually guesses correctly whether a blob contains text or binary data by examining the beginning of the contents. However, sometimes you may want to override its decision, either because a blob contains binary data later in the file, or because the content, while technically composed of text characters, is opaque to a human reader. For example, many postscript files contain only ASCII characters, but produce noisy and meaningless diffs.</p>   <p>The simplest way to mark a file as binary is to unset the diff attribute in the <span class="synopsis"><code>.gitattributes</code></span> file:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>*.ps -diff</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This will cause Git to generate <span class="synopsis"><code>Binary</code> <code>files</code> <code>differ</code></span> (or a binary patch, if binary patches are enabled) instead of a regular diff.</p>   <p>However, one may also want to specify other diff driver attributes. For example, you might want to use <span class="synopsis"><code>textconv</code></span> to convert postscript files to an ASCII representation for human viewing, but otherwise treat them as binary files. You cannot specify both <span class="synopsis"><code>-diff</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>diff=ps</code></span> attributes. The solution is to use the <span class="synopsis"><code>diff.*.binary</code></span> config option:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[diff "ps"]

Defining a custom merge driver</h4>  <p>The definition of a merge driver is done in the <span class="synopsis"><code>.git/config</code></span> file, not in the <span class="synopsis"><code>gitattributes</code></span> file, so strictly speaking this manual page is a wrong place to talk about it. However…​</p>   <p>To define a custom merge driver <span class="synopsis"><code>filfre</code></span>, add a section to your <span class="synopsis"><code>$GIT_DIR/config</code></span> file (or <span class="synopsis"><code>$HOME/.gitconfig</code></span> file) like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[merge "filfre"]
        name = feel-free merge driver
        driver = filfre %O %A %B %L %P
        recursive = binary</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The <span class="synopsis"><code>merge.*.name</code></span> variable gives the driver a human-readable name.</p>   <p>The <span class="synopsis"><code>merge.*.driver</code></span> variable’s value is used to construct a command to run to common ancestor’s version (<span class="synopsis"><code>%O</code></span>), current version (<span class="synopsis"><code>%A</code></span>) and the other branches' version (<span class="synopsis"><code>%B</code></span>). These three tokens are replaced with the names of temporary files that hold the contents of these versions when the command line is built. Additionally, <span class="synopsis"><code>%L</code></span> will be replaced with the conflict marker size (see below).</p>   <p>The merge driver is expected to leave the result of the merge in the file named with <span class="synopsis"><code>%A</code></span> by overwriting it, and exit with zero status if it managed to merge them cleanly, or non-zero if there were conflicts. When the driver crashes (e.g. killed by SEGV), it is expected to exit with non-zero status that are higher than 128, and in such a case, the merge results in a failure (which is different from producing a conflict).</p>   <p>The <span class="synopsis"><code>merge.*.recursive</code></span> variable specifies what other merge driver to use when the merge driver is called for an internal merge between common ancestors, when there are more than one. When left unspecified, the driver itself is used for both internal merge and the final merge.</p>   <p>The merge driver can learn the pathname in which the merged result will be stored via placeholder <span class="synopsis"><code>%P</code></span>. The conflict labels to be used for the common ancestor, local head and other head can be passed by using <span class="synopsis"><code>%S</code></span>, <span class="synopsis"><code>%X</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>%Y</code></span> respectively.</p>  </div> <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_conflict_marker_size">

</h4>  <p>If the attribute <span class="synopsis"><code>export-subst</code></span> is set for a file then Git will expand several placeholders when adding this file to an archive.

The placeholders are the same as those for the option <span class="synopsis"><code>--pretty=format:</code></span> of <a href="git-log">git-log[1]</a>, except that they need to be wrapped like this: <span class="synopsis"><code>$Format:PLACEHOLDERS$</code></span> in the file.
