The sparsity defined by the arguments to the <code>set</code> subcommand are stored in the worktree-specific sparse-checkout file. See <a href="git-worktree">git-worktree[1]</a> and the documentation of <span class="synopsis"><code>extensions.worktreeConfig</code></span> in <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a> for more details.</p>   <p>When the <span class="synopsis"><code>--stdin</code></span> option is provided, the directories or patterns are read from standard in as a newline-delimited list instead of from the arguments.</p>   <p>By default, the input list is considered a list of directories, matching the output of <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>ls-tree</code> <code>-d</code> <code>--name-only</code></span>. This includes interpreting pathnames that begin with a double quote (") as C-style quoted strings. Note that all files under the specified directories (at any depth) will be included in the sparse checkout, as well as files that are siblings of either the given directory or any of its ancestors (see <code>CONE PATTERN SET</code> below for more details). In the past, this was not the default, and <span class="synopsis"><code>--cone</code></span> needed to be specified or <span class="synopsis"><code>core.sparseCheckoutCone</code></span> needed to be enabled.</p>   <p>When <span class="synopsis"><code>--no-cone</code></span> is passed, the input list is considered a list of patterns. This mode has a number of drawbacks, including not working with some options like <span class="synopsis"><code>--sparse-index</code></span>. As explained in the "Non-cone Problems" section below, we do not recommend using it.</p>   <p>Use the <span class="synopsis"><code>--</code>[<code>no-</code>]<code>sparse-index</code></span> option to use a sparse index (the default is to not use it). A sparse index reduces the size of the index to be more closely aligned with your sparse-checkout definition. This can have significant performance advantages for commands such as <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>status</code></span> or <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>add</code></span>. This feature is still experimental. Some commands might be slower with a sparse index until they are properly integrated with the feature.</p>   <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Using a sparse index requires modifying the index in a way that is not completely understood by external tools. If you have trouble with this compatibility, then run <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>sparse-checkout</code> <code>init</code> <code>--no-sparse-index</code></span> to rewrite your index to not be sparse.

<em>reapply</em> </dt> <dd> <p>Reapply the sparsity pattern rules to paths in the working tree. Commands like merge or rebase can materialize paths to do their work (e.g. in order to show you a conflict), and other sparse-checkout commands might fail to sparsify an individual file (e.g. because it has unstaged changes or conflicts). In such cases, it can make sense to run <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>sparse-checkout</code> <code>reapply</code></span> later after cleaning up affected paths (e.g. resolving conflicts, undoing or committing changes, etc.).</p>  <p>The <span class="synopsis"><code>reapply</code></span> command can also take <span class="synopsis"><code>--</code>[<code>no-</code>]<code>cone</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>--</code>[<code>no-</code>]<code>sparse-index</code></span> flags, with the same meaning as the flags from the <span class="synopsis"><code>set</code></span> command, in order to change which sparsity mode you are using without needing to also respecify all sparsity paths.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-sparse-checkout.txt-emcleanem">

Resolve conflicts, stage modifications, and use <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>sparse-checkout</code> <code>reapply</code></span> in conjunction with <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>sparse-checkout</code> <code>clean</code></span> to resolve these cases.</p>   <p>This command can be used to be sure the sparse index works efficiently, though it does not require enabling the sparse index feature via the <span class="synopsis"><code>index.sparse=true</code></span> configuration.</p>   <p>To prevent accidental deletion of worktree files, the <span class="synopsis"><code>clean</code></span> subcommand will not delete any files without the <span class="synopsis"><code>-f</code></span> or <span class="synopsis"><code>--force</code></span> option, unless the <span class="synopsis"><code>clean.requireForce</code></span> config option is set to <span class="synopsis"><code>false</code></span>.</p>   <p>The <span class="synopsis"><code>--dry-run</code></span> option will list the directories that would be removed without deleting them.

Invoking both meant the <span class="synopsis"><code>init</code></span> step would first remove nearly all tracked files (and in cone mode, ignored files too), then the <span class="synopsis"><code>set</code></span> step would add many of the tracked files (but not ignored files) back. In addition to the lost files, the performance and UI of this combination was poor.</p>   <p>Also, historically, <span class="synopsis"><code>init</code></span> would not actually initialize the sparse-checkout file if it already existed. This meant it was possible to return to a sparse-checkout without remembering which paths to pass to a subsequent <code>set</code> or <code>add</code> command. However, <span class="synopsis"><code>--cone</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>--sparse-index</code></span> options would not be remembered across the disable command, so the easy restore of calling a plain <span class="synopsis"><code>init</code></span> decreased in utility.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-sparse-checkout.txt-emcheck-rulesem">

If the skip-worktree bit is set, and the file is not present in the working tree, then its absence is ignored.

In cone mode, these patterns are restricted to matching directories (and users only ever need supply or see directory names), while in non-cone mode any gitignore-style pattern is permitted. Using the full gitignore-style patterns in non-cone mode has a number of shortcomings:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>Fundamentally, it makes various worktree-updating processes (pull, merge, rebase, switch, reset, checkout, etc.) require O(N*M) pattern matches, where N is the number of patterns and M is the number of paths in the index. This scales poorly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoiding the scaling issue has to be done via limiting the number of patterns via specifying leading directory name or glob.</p> </li> <li> <p>Passing globs on the command line is error-prone as users may forget to quote the glob, causing the shell to expand it into all matching files and pass them all individually along to sparse-checkout set/add. While this could also be a problem with e.g. "git grep — *.c", mistakes with grep/log/status appear in the immediate output. With sparse-checkout, the mistake gets recorded at the time the sparse-checkout command is run and might not be problematic until the user later switches branches or rebases or merges, thus putting a delay between the user’s error and when they have a chance to catch/notice it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Related to the previous item, sparse-checkout has an <code>add</code> subcommand but no <code>remove</code> subcommand. Even if a <code>remove</code> subcommand were added, undoing an accidental unquoted glob runs the risk of "removing too much", as it may remove entries that had been included before the accidental add.</p> </li> <li> <p>Non-cone mode uses gitignore-style patterns to select what to <strong>include</strong> (with the exception of negated patterns), while .gitignore files use gitignore-style patterns to select what to <strong>exclude</strong> (with the exception of negated patterns). The documentation on gitignore-style patterns usually does not talk in terms of matching or non-matching, but on what the user wants to "exclude". This can cause confusion for users trying to learn how to specify sparse-checkout patterns to get their desired behavior.</p> </li> <li> <p>Every other git subcommand that wants to provide "special path pattern matching" of some sort uses pathspecs, but non-cone mode for sparse-checkout uses gitignore patterns, which feels inconsistent.</p> </li> <li> <p>It has edge cases where the "right" behavior is unclear. Two examples:</p>  <p>First, two users are in a subdirectory, and the first runs</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell">git sparse-checkout set '/toplevel-dir/*.c'</pre> </div> </div>  <p>while the second runs</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell">git sparse-checkout set relative-dir</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Should those arguments be transliterated into</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>current/subdirectory/toplevel-dir/*.c</pre> </div> </div>  <p>and</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>current/subdirectory/relative-dir</pre> </div> </div>  <p>before inserting into the sparse-checkout file? The user who typed the first command is probably aware that arguments to set/add are supposed to be patterns in non-cone mode, and probably would not be happy with such a transliteration. However, many gitignore-style patterns are just paths, which might be what the user who typed the second command was thinking, and they’d be upset if their argument wasn’t transliterated.</p>   <p>Second, what should bash-completion complete on for set/add commands for non-cone users? If it suggests paths, is it exacerbating the problem above? Also, if it suggests paths, what if the user has a file or directory that begins with either a <code>!</code> or <code>#</code> or has a <code>*</code>, <code>\</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>[</code>, or <code>]</code> in its name? And if it suggests paths, will it complete "/pro" to "/proc" (in the root filesystem) rather than to "/progress.txt" in the current directory? (Note that users are likely to want to start paths with a leading <code>/</code> in non-cone mode, for the same reason that .gitignore files often have one.) Completing on files or directories might give nasty surprises in all these cases.</p>  </li> <li> <p>The excessive flexibility made other extensions essentially impractical. <span class="synopsis"><code>--sparse-index</code></span> is likely impossible in non-cone mode; even if it is somehow feasible, it would have been far more work to implement and may have been too slow in practice. Some ideas for adding coupling between partial clones and sparse checkouts are only practical with a more restricted set of paths as well.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>For all these reasons, non-cone mode is deprecated. Please switch to using cone mode.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_internalscone_mode_handling">Internals — cone mode handling</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>The "cone mode", which is the default, lets you specify only what directories to include. For any directory specified, all paths below that directory will be included, and any paths immediately under leading directories (including the toplevel directory) will also be included. Thus, if you specified the directory Documentation/technical/ then your sparse checkout would contain:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>all files in the toplevel-directory</p> </li> <li> <p>all files immediately under Documentation/</p> </li> <li> <p>all files at any depth under Documentation/technical/</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>Also, in cone mode, even if no directories are specified, then the files in the toplevel directory will be included.</p>   <p>When changing the sparse-checkout patterns in cone mode, Git will inspect each tracked directory that is not within the sparse-checkout cone to see if it contains any untracked files. If all of those files are ignored due to the <span class="synopsis"><code>.gitignore</code></span> patterns, then the directory will be deleted. If any of the untracked files within that directory is not ignored, then no deletions will occur within that directory and a warning message will appear. If these files are important, then reset your sparse-checkout definition so they are included, use <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>add</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>commit</code></span> to store them, then remove any remaining files manually to ensure Git can behave optimally.</p>   <p>See also the "Internals — Cone Pattern Set" section to learn how the directories are transformed under the hood into a subset of the Full Pattern Set of sparse-checkout.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_internalsfull_pattern_set">Internals — full pattern set</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>The full pattern set allows for arbitrary pattern matches and complicated inclusion/exclusion rules. These can result in O(N*M) pattern matches when updating the index, where N is the number of patterns and M is the number of paths in the index. To combat this performance issue, a more restricted pattern set is allowed when <span class="synopsis"><code>core.sparseCheckoutCone</code></span> is enabled.</p>   <p>The sparse-checkout file uses the same syntax as <span class="synopsis"><code>.gitignore</code></span> files; see <a href="gitignore">gitignore[5]</a> for details. Here, though, the patterns are usually being used to select which files to include rather than which files to exclude. (However, it can get a bit confusing since gitignore-style patterns have negations defined by patterns which begin with a <code>!</code>, so you can also select files to <code>not</code> include.)</p>   <p>For example, to select everything, and then to remove the file <span class="synopsis"><code>unwanted</code></span> (so that every file will appear in your working tree except the file named <span class="synopsis"><code>unwanted</code></span>):</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell">git sparse-checkout set --no-cone '/*' '!unwanted'</pre> </div> </div>  <p>These patterns are just placed into the <span class="synopsis"><code>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</code></span> as-is, so the contents of that file at this point would be</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>/*

We refer to the particular patterns used in those mode as being of one of two types:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p><strong>Recursive:</strong> All paths inside a directory are included.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Parent:</strong> All files immediately inside a directory are included.</p> </li> </ol> </div>  <p>Since cone mode always includes files at the toplevel, when running <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>sparse-checkout</code> <code>set</code></span> with no directories specified, the toplevel directory is added as a parent pattern. At this point, the sparse-checkout file contains the following patterns:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>/*
!/*/</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This says "include everything immediately under the toplevel directory, but nothing at any level below that."</p>   <p>When in cone mode, the <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>sparse-checkout</code> <code>set</code></span> subcommand takes a list of directories. The command <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>sparse-checkout</code> <code>set</code> <code>A/B/C</code></span> sets the directory <span class="synopsis"><code>A/B/C</code></span> as a recursive pattern, the directories <span class="synopsis"><code>A</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>A/B</code></span> are added as parent patterns. The resulting sparse-checkout file is now</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>/*
!/*/
/A/
!/A/*/
/A/B/
!/A/B/*/
/A/B/C/</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Here, order matters, so the negative patterns are overridden by the positive patterns that appear lower in the file.</p>   <p>Unless <span class="synopsis"><code>core.sparseCheckoutCone</code></span> is explicitly set to <span class="synopsis"><code>false</code></span>, Git will parse the sparse-checkout file expecting patterns of these types. Git will warn if the patterns do not match. If the patterns do match the expected format, then Git will use faster hash-based algorithms to compute inclusion in the sparse-checkout. If they do not match, git will behave as though <span class="synopsis"><code>core.sparseCheckoutCone</code></span> was false, regardless of its setting.</p>   <p>In the cone mode case, despite the fact that full patterns are written to the $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout file, the <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>sparse-checkout</code> <code>list</code></span> subcommand will list the directories that define the recursive patterns. For the example sparse-checkout file above, the output is as follows:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git sparse-checkout list
A/B/C</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If <span class="synopsis"><code>core.ignoreCase=true</code></span>, then the pattern-matching algorithm will use a case-insensitive check.

Similar to how sparse-checkout removes files from the working tree but still leaves entries in the index, deinitialized submodules are removed from the working directory but still have an entry in the index.</p>   <p>Since submodules may have unpushed changes or untracked files, removing them could result in data loss. Thus, changing sparse inclusion/exclusion rules will not cause an already checked out submodule to be removed from the working copy. Said another way, just as <span class="synopsis"><code>checkout</code></span> will not cause submodules to be automatically removed or initialized even when switching between branches that remove or add submodules, using <span class="synopsis"><code>sparse-checkout</code></span> to reduce or expand the scope of "interesting" files will not cause submodules to be automatically deinitialized or initialized either.</p>   <p>Further, the above facts mean that there are multiple reasons that "tracked" files might not be present in the working copy: sparsity pattern application from sparse-checkout, and submodule initialization state. Thus, commands like <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>grep</code></span> that work on tracked files in the working copy may return results that are limited by either or both of these restrictions.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_see_also">See also</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p><a href="git-read-tree">git-read-tree[1]</a> <a href="gitignore">gitignore[5]</a></p>  </div>      <h3 hidden="true" data-pagefind-weight="7">sparse-checkout</h3><div class="_attribution">
