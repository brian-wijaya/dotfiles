As such, it’s "reasonably stable", but at the same time also reasonably unique, i.e., two patches that have the same "patch ID" are almost guaranteed to be the same thing.</p>   <p>The main usecase for this command is to look for likely duplicate commits.</p>   <p>When dealing with <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>diff-tree</code></span> output, it takes advantage of the fact that the patch is prefixed with the object name of the commit, and outputs two 40-byte hexadecimal strings. The first string is the patch ID, and the second string is the commit ID. This can be used to make a mapping from patch ID to commit ID.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_options">Options</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-patch-id.txt-spanclasssynopsiscode--verbatimcodespan">
