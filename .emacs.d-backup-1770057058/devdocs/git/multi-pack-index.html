<h1>multi-pack-index</h1>  <div class="sectionbody">  <p>The Git object directory contains a <code>pack</code> directory containing packfiles (with suffix ".pack") and pack-indexes (with suffix ".idx"). The pack-indexes provide a way to lookup objects and navigate to their offset within the pack, but these must come in pairs with the packfiles. This pairing depends on the file names, as the pack-index differs only in suffix with its pack- file. While the pack-indexes provide fast lookup per packfile, this performance degrades as the number of packfiles increases, because abbreviations need to inspect every packfile and we are more likely to have a miss on our most-recently-used packfile. For some large repositories, repacking into a single packfile is not feasible due to storage space or excessive repack times.</p>   <p>The multi-pack-index (MIDX for short) stores a list of objects and their offsets into multiple packfiles. It contains:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>A list of packfile names.</p> </li> <li> <p>A sorted list of object IDs.</p> </li> <li> <p>A list of metadata for the ith object ID including:</p> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>A value j referring to the jth packfile.</p> </li> <li> <p>An offset within the jth packfile for the object.</p> </li> </ul> </div> </li> <li> <p>If large offsets are required, we use another list of large offsets similar to version 2 pack-indexes.</p> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>An optional list of objects in pseudo-pack order (used with MIDX bitmaps).</p> </li> </ul> </div> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>Thus, we can provide O(log N) lookup time for any number of packfiles.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_design_details">Design details</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The MIDX is stored in a file named <code>multi-pack-index</code> in the .git/objects/pack directory.

To accommodate this, the "incremental multi-pack indexes" feature allows for combining a "chain" of multi-pack indexes.</p>   <p>Each individual component of the chain need only contain a small number of packfiles. Appending to the chain does not invalidate earlier parts of the chain, so repositories can control how much time is spent updating the MIDX chain by determining the number of packs in each layer of the MIDX chain.</p>  <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_design_state">
Design state</h3>  <p>At present, the incremental multi-pack indexes feature is missing two important components:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>The ability to rewrite earlier portions of the MIDX chain (i.e., to "compact" some collection of adjacent MIDX layers into a single MIDX). At present the only supported way of shrinking a MIDX chain is to rewrite the entire chain from scratch without the <span class="synopsis"><code>--split</code></span> flag.</p>  <p>There are no fundamental limitations that stand in the way of being able to implement this feature. It is omitted from the initial implementation in order to reduce the complexity, but will be added later.</p>  </li> <li> <p>Support for reachability bitmaps. The classic single MIDX implementation does support reachability bitmaps (see the section titled "multi-pack-index reverse indexes" in <a href="gitformat-pack">gitformat-pack[5]</a> for more details).</p>  <p>As above, there are no fundamental limitations that stand in the way of extending the incremental MIDX format to support reachability bitmaps. The design below specifically takes this into account, and support for reachability bitmaps will be added in a future patch series. It is omitted from the current implementation for the same reason as above.</p>   <p>In brief, to support reachability bitmaps with the incremental MIDX feature, the concept of the pseudo-pack order is extended across each layer of the incremental MIDX chain to form a concatenated pseudo-pack order. This concatenation takes place in the same order as the chain itself (in other words, the concatenated pseudo-pack order for a chain <span class="synopsis"><code>{$H1,</code> <code>$H2,</code> <code>$H3}</code></span> would be the pseudo-pack order for <span class="synopsis"><code>$H1</code></span>, followed by the pseudo-pack order for <span class="synopsis"><code>$H2</code></span>, followed by the pseudo-pack order for <span class="synopsis"><code>$H3</code></span>).</p>   <p>The layout will then be extended so that each layer of the incremental MIDX chain can write a <span class="synopsis"><code>*.bitmap</code></span>. The objects in each layer’s bitmap are offset by the number of objects in the previous layers of the chain.</p>  </li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_file_layout">
File layout</h3>  <p>Instead of storing a single <span class="synopsis"><code>multi-pack-index</code></span> file (with an optional <span class="synopsis"><code>.rev</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>.bitmap</code></span> extension) in <span class="synopsis"><code>$GIT_DIR/objects/pack</code></span>, incremental MIDXs are stored in the following layout:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$GIT_DIR/objects/pack/multi-pack-index.d/

$GIT_DIR/objects/pack/multi-pack-index.d/multi-pack-index-$H3.midx</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The <span class="synopsis"><code>multi-pack-index-chain</code></span> file contains a list of the incremental MIDX files in the chain, in order. The above example shows a chain whose <span class="synopsis"><code>multi-pack-index-chain</code></span> file would contain the following lines:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$H1
$H2
$H3</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The <span class="synopsis"><code>multi-pack-index-$H1.midx</code></span> file contains the first layer of the multi-pack-index chain. The <span class="synopsis"><code>multi-pack-index-$H2.midx</code></span> file contains the second layer of the chain, and so on.</p>   <p>When both an incremental- and non-incremental MIDX are present, the non-incremental MIDX is always read first.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_object_positions_for_incremental_midxs">
Object positions for incremental MIDXs</h3>  <p>In the original multi-pack-index design, we refer to objects via their lexicographic position (by object IDs) within the repository’s singular multi-pack-index. In the incremental multi-pack-index design, we refer to objects via their index into a concatenated lexicographic ordering among each component in the MIDX chain.</p>   <p>If <span class="synopsis"><code>objects_nr</code>()</span> is a function that returns the number of objects in a given MIDX layer, then the index of an object at lexicographic position <span class="synopsis"><code>i</code></span> within, say, $H3 is defined as:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>objects_nr($H2) + objects_nr($H1) + i</pre> </div> </div>  <p>(in the C implementation, this is often computed as <span class="synopsis"><em>i + </em> <em>m-&gt;num_objects_in_base</em></span>).</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_pseudo_pack_order_for_incremental_midxs">
Pseudo-pack order for incremental MIDXs</h3>  <p>The original implementation of multi-pack reachability bitmaps defined the pseudo-pack order in <a href="gitformat-pack">gitformat-pack[5]</a> (see the section titled "multi-pack-index reverse indexes") roughly as follows:</p>  <div class="quoteblock"> <blockquote>  <p>In short, a MIDX’s pseudo-pack is the de-duplicated concatenation of objects in packs stored by the MIDX, laid out in pack order, and the packs arranged in MIDX order (with the preferred pack coming first).</p>  </blockquote> </div>  <p>In the incremental MIDX design, we extend this definition to include objects from multiple layers of the MIDX chain. The pseudo-pack order for incremental MIDXs is determined by concatenating the pseudo-pack ordering for each layer of the MIDX chain in order. Formally two objects <span class="synopsis"><code>o1</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>o2</code></span> are compared as follows:</p>  <div class="olist arabic"> <ol class="arabic"> <li> <p>If <span class="synopsis"><code>o1</code></span> appears in an earlier layer of the MIDX chain than <span class="synopsis"><code>o2</code></span>, then <span class="synopsis"><code>o1</code></span> sorts ahead of <span class="synopsis"><code>o2</code></span>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Otherwise, if <span class="synopsis"><code>o1</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>o2</code></span> appear in the same MIDX layer, and that MIDX layer has no base, then if one of <span class="synopsis"><code>pack</code>(<code>o1</code>)</span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>pack</code>(<code>o2</code>)</span> is preferred and the other is not, then the preferred one sorts ahead of the non-preferred one. If there is a base layer (i.e. the MIDX layer is not the first layer in the chain), then if <span class="synopsis"><code>pack</code>(<code>o1</code>)</span> appears earlier in that MIDX layer’s pack order, then <span class="synopsis"><code>o1</code></span> sorts ahead of <span class="synopsis"><code>o2</code></span>. Likewise if <span class="synopsis"><code>pack</code>(<code>o2</code>)</span> appears earlier, then the opposite is true.</p> </li> <li> <p>Otherwise, <span class="synopsis"><code>o1</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>o2</code></span> appear in the same pack, and thus in the same MIDX layer. Sort <span class="synopsis"><code>o1</code></span> and <span class="synopsis"><code>o2</code></span> by their offset within their containing packfile.</p> </li> </ol> </div>  <p>Note that the preferred pack is a property of the MIDX chain, not the individual layers themselves. Fundamentally we could introduce a per-layer preferred pack, but this is less relevant now that we can perform multi-pack reuse across the set of packs in a MIDX.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_reachability_bitmaps_and_incremental_midxs">
Reachability bitmaps and incremental MIDXs</h3>  <p>Each layer of an incremental MIDX chain may have its objects (and the objects from any previous layer in the same MIDX chain) represented in its own <span class="synopsis"><code>*.bitmap</code></span> file.</p>   <p>The structure of a <span class="synopsis"><code>*.bitmap</code></span> file belonging to an incremental MIDX chain is identical to that of a non-incremental MIDX bitmap, or a classic single-pack bitmap. Since objects are added to the end of the incremental MIDX’s pseudo-pack order (see above), it is possible to extend a bitmap when appending to the end of a MIDX chain.</p>   <p>(Note: it is possible likewise to compress a contiguous sequence of MIDX incremental layers, and their <span class="synopsis"><code>*.bitmap</code></span> files into a single layer and <span class="synopsis"><code>*.bitmap</code></span>, but this is not yet implemented.)</p>   <p>The object positions used are global within the pseudo-pack order, so subsequent layers will have, for example, <span class="synopsis"><em>m-&gt;num_objects_in_base</em></span> number of <span class="synopsis"><code>0</code></span> bits in each of their four type bitmaps. This follows from the fact that we only write type bitmap entries for objects present in the layer immediately corresponding to the bitmap).</p>   <p>Note also that only the bitmap pertaining to the most recent layer in an incremental MIDX chain is used to store reachability information about the interesting and uninteresting objects in a reachability query. Earlier bitmap layers are only used to look up commit and pseudo-merge bitmaps from that layer, as well as the type-level bitmaps for objects in that layer.</p>   <p>To simplify the implementation, type-level bitmaps are iterated simultaneously, and their results are OR’d together to avoid recursively calling internal bitmap functions.</p>  </div> </div>   <h2 id="_future_work">Future work</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>If the multi-pack-index is extended to store a "stable object order" (a function Order(hash) = integer that is constant for a given hash, even as the multi-pack-index is updated) then MIDX bitmaps could be updated independently of the MIDX.</p> </li> <li> <p>Packfiles can be marked as "special" using empty files that share the initial name but replace ".pack" with ".keep" or ".promisor". We can add an optional chunk of data to the multi-pack-index that records flags of information about the packfiles. This allows new states, such as <code>repacked</code> or <code>redeltified</code>, that can help with pack maintenance in a multi-pack environment. It may also be helpful to organize packfiles by object type (commit, tree, blob, etc.) and use this metadata to help that maintenance.</p> </li> </ul> </div> </div>   <h2 id="_related_links">Related links</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>[0] <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/git/issues/detail?id=6" class="bare">https://bugs.chromium.org/p/git/issues/detail?id=6</a> Chromium work item for: Multi-Pack Index (MIDX)</p>   <p>[1] <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20180107181459.222909-1-dstolee@microsoft.com/" class="bare">https://lore.kernel.org/git/20180107181459.222909-1-dstolee@microsoft.com/</a> An earlier RFC for the multi-pack-index feature</p>   <p>[2] <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/alpine.DEB.2.20.1803091557510.23109@alexmv-linux/" class="bare">https://lore.kernel.org/git/alpine.DEB.2.20.1803091557510.23109@alexmv-linux/</a> Git Merge 2018 Contributor’s summit notes (includes discussion of MIDX)</p>  </div><div class="_attribution">
