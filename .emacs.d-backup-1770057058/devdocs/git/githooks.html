<h1>githooks</h1>  <h2 id="_name">Name</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>githooks - Hooks used by Git</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_synopsis">Synopsis</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>$GIT_DIR/hooks/* (or `git config core.hooksPath`/*)</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_description">Description</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Hooks are programs you can place in a hooks directory to trigger actions at certain points in git’s execution. Hooks that don’t have the executable bit set are ignored.</p>   <p>By default the hooks directory is <span class="synopsis"><code>$GIT_DIR/hooks</code></span>, but that can be changed via the <span class="synopsis"><code>core.hooksPath</code></span> configuration variable (see <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a>).</p>   <p>Before Git invokes a hook, it changes its working directory to either $GIT_DIR in a bare repository or the root of the working tree in a non-bare repository. An exception are hooks triggered during a push (<code>pre-receive</code>, <code>update</code>, <code>post-receive</code>, <code>post-update</code>, <code>push-to-checkout</code>) which are always executed in $GIT_DIR.</p>   <p>Environment variables, such as <span class="synopsis"><code>GIT_DIR</code></span>, <span class="synopsis"><code>GIT_WORK_TREE</code></span>, etc., are exported so that Git commands run by the hook can correctly locate the repository. If your hook needs to invoke Git commands in a foreign repository or in a different working tree of the same repository, then it should clear these environment variables so they do not interfere with Git operations at the foreign location. For example:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>local_desc=$(git describe)
foreign_desc=$(unset $(git rev-parse --local-env-vars); git -C ../foreign-repo describe)</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Hooks can get their arguments via the environment, command-line arguments, and stdin. See the documentation for each hook below for details.</p>   <p><span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>init</code></span> may copy hooks to the new repository, depending on its configuration. See the "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section in <a href="git-init">git-init[1]</a> for details. When the rest of this document refers to "default hooks" it’s talking about the default template shipped with Git.</p>   <p>The currently supported hooks are described below.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_hooks">Hooks</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_applypatch_msg">
applypatch-msg</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-am">git-am[1]</a>. It takes a single parameter, the name of the file that holds the proposed commit log message. Exiting with a non-zero status causes <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>am</code></span> to abort before applying the patch.</p>   <p>The hook is allowed to edit the message file in place, and can be used to normalize the message into some project standard format. It can also be used to refuse the commit after inspecting the message file.</p>   <p>The default <code>applypatch-msg</code> hook, when enabled, runs the <code>commit-msg</code> hook, if the latter is enabled.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_pre_applypatch">
pre-applypatch</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-am">git-am[1]</a>. It takes no parameter, and is invoked after the patch is applied, but before a commit is made.</p>   <p>If it exits with non-zero status, then the working tree will not be committed after applying the patch.</p>   <p>It can be used to inspect the current working tree and refuse to make a commit if it does not pass certain tests.</p>   <p>The default <code>pre-applypatch</code> hook, when enabled, runs the <code>pre-commit</code> hook, if the latter is enabled.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_post_applypatch">
post-applypatch</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-am">git-am[1]</a>.

pre-commit</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-commit">git-commit[1]</a>, and can be bypassed with the <span class="synopsis"><code>--no-verify</code></span> option. It takes no parameters, and is invoked before obtaining the proposed commit log message and making a commit. Exiting with a non-zero status from this script causes the <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>commit</code></span> command to abort before creating a commit.</p>   <p>The default <code>pre-commit</code> hook, when enabled, catches introduction of lines with trailing whitespaces and aborts the commit when such a line is found.</p>   <p>All the <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>commit</code></span> hooks are invoked with the environment variable <span class="synopsis"><code>GIT_EDITOR=:</code></span> if the command will not bring up an editor to modify the commit message.</p>   <p>The default <code>pre-commit</code> hook, when enabled—​and with the <span class="synopsis"><code>hooks.allownonascii</code></span> config option unset or set to false—​prevents the use of non-ASCII filenames.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_pre_merge_commit">
pre-merge-commit</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-merge">git-merge[1]</a>, and can be bypassed with the <span class="synopsis"><code>--no-verify</code></span> option. It takes no parameters, and is invoked after the merge has been carried out successfully and before obtaining the proposed commit log message to make a commit. Exiting with a non-zero status from this script causes the <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>merge</code></span> command to abort before creating a commit.</p>   <p>The default <code>pre-merge-commit</code> hook, when enabled, runs the <code>pre-commit</code> hook, if the latter is enabled.</p>   <p>This hook is invoked with the environment variable <span class="synopsis"><code>GIT_EDITOR=:</code></span> if the command will not bring up an editor to modify the commit message.</p>   <p>If the merge cannot be carried out automatically, the conflicts need to be resolved and the result committed separately (see <a href="git-merge">git-merge[1]</a>). At that point, this hook will not be executed, but the <code>pre-commit</code> hook will, if it is enabled.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_prepare_commit_msg">
prepare-commit-msg</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-commit">git-commit[1]</a> right after preparing the default log message, and before the editor is started.</p>   <p>It takes one to three parameters. The first is the name of the file that contains the commit log message. The second is the source of the commit message, and can be: <span class="synopsis"><code>message</code></span> (if a <span class="synopsis"><code>-m</code></span> or <span class="synopsis"><code>-F</code></span> option was given); <span class="synopsis"><code>template</code></span> (if a <span class="synopsis"><code>-t</code></span> option was given or the configuration option <span class="synopsis"><code>commit.template</code></span> is set); <span class="synopsis"><code>merge</code></span> (if the commit is a merge or a <span class="synopsis"><code>.git/MERGE_MSG</code></span> file exists); <span class="synopsis"><code>squash</code></span> (if a <span class="synopsis"><code>.git/SQUASH_MSG</code></span> file exists); or <span class="synopsis"><code>commit</code></span>, followed by a commit object name (if a <span class="synopsis"><code>-c</code></span>, <span class="synopsis"><code>-C</code></span> or <span class="synopsis"><code>--amend</code></span> option was given).</p>   <p>If the exit status is non-zero, <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>commit</code></span> will abort.</p>   <p>The purpose of the hook is to edit the message file in place, and it is not suppressed by the <span class="synopsis"><code>--no-verify</code></span> option. A non-zero exit means a failure of the hook and aborts the commit. It should not be used as a replacement for the pre-commit hook.</p>   <p>The sample <span class="synopsis"><code>prepare-commit-msg</code></span> hook that comes with Git removes the help message found in the commented portion of the commit template.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_commit_msg">
commit-msg</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-commit">git-commit[1]</a> and <a href="git-merge">git-merge[1]</a>, and can be bypassed with the <span class="synopsis"><code>--no-verify</code></span> option. It takes a single parameter, the name of the file that holds the proposed commit log message. Exiting with a non-zero status causes the command to abort.</p>   <p>The hook is allowed to edit the message file in place, and can be used to normalize the message into some project standard format. It can also be used to refuse the commit after inspecting the message file.</p>   <p>The default <code>commit-msg</code> hook, when enabled, detects duplicate <span class="synopsis"><code>Signed-off-by</code></span> trailers, and aborts the commit if one is found.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_post_commit">
post-commit</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-commit">git-commit[1]</a>. It takes no parameters, and is invoked after a commit is made.</p>   <p>This hook is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect the outcome of <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>commit</code></span>.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_pre_rebase">
pre-rebase</h3>  <p>This hook is called by <a href="git-rebase">git-rebase[1]</a> and can be used to prevent a branch from getting rebased. The hook may be called with one or two parameters. The first parameter is the upstream from which the series was forked. The second parameter is the branch being rebased, and is not set when rebasing the current branch.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_post_checkout">
post-checkout</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked when a <a href="git-checkout">git-checkout[1]</a> or <a href="git-switch">git-switch[1]</a> is run after having updated the worktree. The hook is given three parameters: the ref of the previous HEAD, the ref of the new HEAD (which may or may not have changed), and a flag indicating whether the checkout was a branch checkout (changing branches, flag=1) or a file checkout (retrieving a file from the index, flag=0). This hook cannot affect the outcome of <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>switch</code></span> or <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>checkout</code></span>, other than that the hook’s exit status becomes the exit status of these two commands.</p>   <p>It is also run after <a href="git-clone">git-clone[1]</a>, unless the <span class="synopsis"><code>--no-checkout</code></span> (<span class="synopsis"><code>-n</code></span>) option is used. The first parameter given to the hook is the null-ref, the second the ref of the new HEAD and the flag is always 1. Likewise for <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>worktree</code> <code>add</code></span> unless <span class="synopsis"><code>--no-checkout</code></span> is used.</p>   <p>This hook can be used to perform repository validity checks, auto-display differences from the previous HEAD if different, or set working dir metadata properties.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_post_merge">
post-merge</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-merge">git-merge[1]</a>, which happens when a <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>pull</code></span> is done on a local repository. The hook takes a single parameter, a status flag specifying whether or not the merge being done was a squash merge. This hook cannot affect the outcome of <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>merge</code></span> and is not executed, if the merge failed due to conflicts.</p>   <p>This hook can be used in conjunction with a corresponding pre-commit hook to save and restore any form of metadata associated with the working tree (e.g.: permissions/ownership, ACLS, etc). See contrib/hooks/setgitperms.perl for an example of how to do this.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_pre_push">
pre-push</h3>  <p>This hook is called by <a href="git-push">git-push[1]</a> and can be used to prevent a push from taking place. The hook is called with two parameters which provide the name and location of the destination remote, if a named remote is not being used both values will be the same.</p>   <p>Information about what is to be pushed is provided on the hook’s standard input with lines of the form:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>&lt;local-ref&gt; SP &lt;local-object-name&gt; SP &lt;remote-ref&gt; SP &lt;remote-object-name&gt; LF</pre> </div> </div>  <p>For instance, if the command <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>push</code> <code>origin</code> <code>master:foreign</code></span> were run the hook would receive a line like the following:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>refs/heads/master 67890 refs/heads/foreign 12345</pre> </div> </div>  <p>although the full object name would be supplied. If the foreign ref does not yet exist the <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;remote-object-name&gt;</em></span> will be the all-zeroes object name. If a ref is to be deleted, the <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;local-ref&gt;</em></span> will be supplied as <span class="synopsis">(<code>delete</code>)</span> and the <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;local-object-name&gt;</em></span> will be the all-zeroes object name. If the local commit was specified by something other than a name which could be expanded (such as <span class="synopsis"><code>HEAD~</code></span>, or an object name) it will be supplied as it was originally given.</p>   <p>If this hook exits with a non-zero status, <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>push</code></span> will abort without pushing anything. Information about why the push is rejected may be sent to the user by writing to standard error.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="pre-receive">
pre-receive</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-receive-pack">git-receive-pack[1]</a> when it reacts to <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>push</code></span> and updates reference(s) in its repository. Just before starting to update refs on the remote repository, the pre-receive hook is invoked. Its exit status determines the success or failure of the update.</p>   <p>This hook executes once for the receive operation. It takes no arguments, but for each ref to be updated it receives on standard input a line of the format:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>&lt;old-oid&gt; SP &lt;new-oid&gt; SP &lt;ref-name&gt; LF</pre> </div> </div>  <p>where <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;old-oid&gt;</em></span> is the old object name stored in the ref, <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;new-oid&gt;</em></span> is the new object name to be stored in the ref and <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;ref-name&gt;</em></span> is the full name of the ref. When creating a new ref, <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;old-oid&gt;</em></span> is the all-zeroes object name.</p>   <p>If the hook exits with non-zero status, none of the refs will be updated. If the hook exits with zero, updating of individual refs can still be prevented by the <a href="#update"><em>update</em></a> hook.</p>   <p>Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>send-pack</code></span> on the other end, so you can simply <span class="synopsis"><code>echo</code></span> messages for the user.</p>   <p>The number of push options given on the command line of <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>push</code> <code>--push-option=...</code></span> can be read from the environment variable <span class="synopsis"><code>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT</code></span>, and the options themselves are found in <span class="synopsis"><code>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_0</code></span>, <span class="synopsis"><code>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_1</code></span>,…​ If it is negotiated to not use the push options phase, the environment variables will not be set. If the client selects to use push options, but doesn’t transmit any, the count variable will be set to zero, <span class="synopsis"><code>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT=0</code></span>.</p>   <p>See the section on "Quarantine Environment" in <a href="git-receive-pack">git-receive-pack[1]</a> for some caveats.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="update">
update</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-receive-pack">git-receive-pack[1]</a> when it reacts to <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>push</code></span> and updates reference(s) in its repository. Just before updating the ref on the remote repository, the update hook is invoked. Its exit status determines the success or failure of the ref update.</p>   <p>The hook executes once for each ref to be updated, and takes three parameters:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>the name of the ref being updated,</p> </li> <li> <p>the old object name stored in the ref,</p> </li> <li> <p>and the new object name to be stored in the ref.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>A zero exit from the update hook allows the ref to be updated. Exiting with a non-zero status prevents <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>receive-pack</code></span> from updating that ref.</p>   <p>This hook can be used to prevent <code>forced</code> update on certain refs by making sure that the object name is a commit object that is a descendant of the commit object named by the old object name. That is, to enforce a "fast-forward only" policy.</p>   <p>It could also be used to log the old..new status. However, it does not know the entire set of branches, so it would end up firing one e-mail per ref when used naively, though. The <a href="#post-receive"><em>post-receive</em></a> hook is more suited to that.</p>   <p>In an environment that restricts the users' access only to git commands over the wire, this hook can be used to implement access control without relying on filesystem ownership and group membership. See <a href="git-shell">git-shell[1]</a> for how you might use the login shell to restrict the user’s access to only git commands.</p>   <p>Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>send-pack</code></span> on the other end, so you can simply <span class="synopsis"><code>echo</code></span> messages for the user.</p>   <p>The default <code>update</code> hook, when enabled—​and with <span class="synopsis"><code>hooks.allowunannotated</code></span> config option unset or set to false—​prevents unannotated tags from being pushed.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="proc-receive">
proc-receive</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-receive-pack">git-receive-pack[1]</a>. If the server has set the multi-valued config variable <span class="synopsis"><code>receive.procReceiveRefs</code></span>, and the commands sent to <code>receive-pack</code> have matching reference names, these commands will be executed by this hook, instead of by the internal <span class="synopsis"><code>execute_commands</code>()</span> function. This hook is responsible for updating the relevant references and reporting the results back to <code>receive-pack</code>.</p>   <p>This hook executes once for the receive operation. It takes no arguments, but uses a pkt-line format protocol to communicate with <code>receive-pack</code> to read commands, push-options and send results. In the following example for the protocol, the letter <code>S</code> stands for <code>receive-pack</code> and the letter <code>H</code> stands for this hook.</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre># Version and features negotiation.

post-receive</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-receive-pack">git-receive-pack[1]</a> when it reacts to <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>push</code></span> and updates reference(s) in its repository. The hook executes on the remote repository once after all the proposed ref updates are processed and if at least one ref is updated as the result.</p>   <p>The hook takes no arguments. It receives one line on standard input for each ref that is successfully updated following the same format as the <a href="#pre-receive"><em>pre-receive</em></a> hook.</p>   <p>This hook does not affect the outcome of <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>receive-pack</code></span>, as it is called after the real work is done.</p>   <p>This supersedes the <a href="#post-update"><em>post-update</em></a> hook in that it gets both old and new values of all the refs in addition to their names.</p>   <p>Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>send-pack</code></span> on the other end, so you can simply <span class="synopsis"><code>echo</code></span> messages for the user.</p>   <p>The default <code>post-receive</code> hook is empty, but there is a sample script <span class="synopsis"><code>post-receive-email</code></span> provided in the <span class="synopsis"><code>contrib/hooks</code></span> directory in Git distribution, which implements sending commit emails.</p>   <p>The number of push options given on the command line of <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>push</code> <code>--push-option=...</code></span> can be read from the environment variable <span class="synopsis"><code>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT</code></span>, and the options themselves are found in <span class="synopsis"><code>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_0</code></span>, <span class="synopsis"><code>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_1</code></span>,…​ If it is negotiated to not use the push options phase, the environment variables will not be set.

post-update</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-receive-pack">git-receive-pack[1]</a> when it reacts to <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>push</code></span> and updates reference(s) in its repository. It executes on the remote repository once after all the refs have been updated.</p>   <p>It takes a variable number of parameters, each of which is the name of ref that was actually updated.</p>   <p>This hook is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect the outcome of <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>receive-pack</code></span>.</p>   <p>The <code>post-update</code> hook can tell what are the heads that were pushed, but it does not know what their original and updated values are, so it is a poor place to do log old..new.

reference-transaction</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by any Git command that performs reference updates. It executes whenever a reference transaction is prepared, committed or aborted and may thus get called multiple times. The hook also supports symbolic reference updates.</p>   <p>The hook takes exactly one argument, which is the current state the given reference transaction is in:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>"prepared": All reference updates have been queued to the transaction and references were locked on disk.</p> </li> <li> <p>"committed": The reference transaction was committed and all references now have their respective new value.</p> </li> <li> <p>"aborted": The reference transaction was aborted, no changes were performed and the locks have been released.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>For each reference update that was added to the transaction, the hook receives on standard input a line of the format:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>&lt;old-value&gt; SP &lt;new-value&gt; SP &lt;ref-name&gt; LF</pre> </div> </div>  <p>where <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;old-value&gt;</em></span> is the old object name passed into the reference transaction, <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;new-value&gt;</em></span> is the new object name to be stored in the ref and <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;ref-name&gt;</em></span> is the full name of the ref. When force updating the reference regardless of its current value or when the reference is to be created anew, <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;old-value&gt;</em></span> is the all-zeroes object name. To distinguish these cases, you can inspect the current value of <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;ref-name&gt;</em></span> via <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>rev-parse</code></span>.</p>   <p>For symbolic reference updates the <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;old_value&gt;</em></span> and <span class="synopsis"><em>&lt;new-value&gt;</em></span> fields could denote references instead of objects. A reference will be denoted with a <code>ref:</code> prefix, like <span class="synopsis"><code>ref:</code><em>&lt;ref-target&gt;</em></span>.</p>   <p>The exit status of the hook is ignored for any state except for the "prepared" state. In the "prepared" state, a non-zero exit status will cause the transaction to be aborted. The hook will not be called with "aborted" state in that case.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_push_to_checkout">
push-to-checkout</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-receive-pack">git-receive-pack[1]</a> when it reacts to <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>push</code></span> and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the <span class="synopsis"><code>receive.denyCurrentBranch</code></span> configuration variable is set to <span class="synopsis"><code>updateInstead</code></span>. Such a push by default is refused if the working tree and the index of the remote repository has any difference from the currently checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default behaviour.</p>   <p>The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current branch is going to be updated. It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does so, it must not modify the index or the working tree). Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.</p>   <p>For example, the hook can simply run <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>read-tree</code> <code>-u</code> <code>-m</code> <code>HEAD</code> <code>"$1"</code></span> in order to emulate <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>fetch</code></span> that is run in the reverse direction with <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>push</code></span>, as the two-tree form of <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>read-tree</code> <code>-u</code> <code>-m</code></span> is essentially the same as <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>switch</code></span> or <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>checkout</code></span> that switches branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do not interfere with the difference between the branches.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_pre_auto_gc">
pre-auto-gc</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>gc</code> <code>--auto</code></span> (see <a href="git-gc">git-gc[1]</a>). It takes no parameter, and exiting with non-zero status from this script causes the <span class="synopsis"><code>git</code> <code>gc</code> <code>--auto</code></span> to abort.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_post_rewrite">
post-rewrite</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by commands that rewrite commits (<a href="git-commit">git-commit[1]</a> when called with <span class="synopsis"><code>--amend</code></span> and <a href="git-rebase">git-rebase[1]</a>; however, full-history (re)writing tools like <a href="git-fast-import">git-fast-import[1]</a> or <a href="https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo">git-filter-repo</a> typically do not call it!). Its first argument denotes the command it was invoked by: currently one of <span class="synopsis"><code>amend</code></span> or <span class="synopsis"><code>rebase</code></span>. Further command-dependent arguments may be passed in the future.</p>   <p>The hook receives a list of the rewritten commits on stdin, in the format</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>&lt;old-object-name&gt; SP &lt;new-object-name&gt; [ SP &lt;extra-info&gt; ] LF</pre> </div> </div>  <p>The <code>extra-info</code> is again command-dependent. If it is empty, the preceding SP is also omitted. Currently, no commands pass any <code>extra-info</code>.</p>   <p>The hook always runs after the automatic note copying (see "notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;" in <a href="git-config">git-config[1]</a>) has happened, and thus has access to these notes.</p>   <p>The following command-specific comments apply:</p>  <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/githooks.txt-rebase">
rebase </dt> <dd> <p>For the <code>squash</code> and <code>fixup</code> operation, all commits that were squashed are listed as being rewritten to the squashed commit. This means that there will be several lines sharing the same <code>new-object-name</code>.</p>  <p>The commits are guaranteed to be listed in the order that they were processed by rebase.</p>  </dd> </dl> </div> </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_sendemail_validate">
sendemail-validate</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked by <a href="git-send-email">git-send-email[1]</a>.</p>   <p>It takes these command line arguments. They are, 1. the name of the file which holds the contents of the email to be sent. 2. The name of the file which holds the SMTP headers of the email.</p>   <p>The SMTP headers are passed in the exact same way as they are passed to the user’s Mail Transport Agent (MTA). In effect, the email given to the user’s MTA, is the contents of $2 followed by the contents of $1.</p>   <p>An example of a few common headers is shown below. Take notice of the capitalization and multi-line tab structure.</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>From: Example &lt;from@example.com&gt;

<span class="synopsis"><code>GIT_SENDEMAIL_FILE_COUNTER</code></span> </dt> <dd> <p>A 1-based counter incremented by one for every file holding an e-mail to be sent (excluding any FIFOs). This counter does not follow the patch series counter scheme. It will always start at 1 and will end at GIT_SENDEMAIL_FILE_TOTAL.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/githooks.txt-spanclasssynopsiscodeGITSENDEMAILFILETOTALcodespan">
<span class="synopsis"><code>GIT_SENDEMAIL_FILE_TOTAL</code></span> </dt> <dd> <p>The total number of files that will be sent (excluding any FIFOs). This counter does not follow the patch series counter scheme. It will always be equal to the number of files being sent, whether there is a cover letter or not.</p> </dd> </dl> </div>  <p>These variables may for instance be used to validate patch series.</p>   <p>The sample <span class="synopsis"><code>sendemail-validate</code></span> hook that comes with Git checks that all sent patches (excluding the cover letter) can be applied on top of the upstream repository default branch without conflicts. Some placeholders are left for additional validation steps to be performed after all patches of a given series have been applied.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_fsmonitor_watchman">
fsmonitor-watchman</h3>  <p>This hook is invoked when the configuration option <span class="synopsis"><code>core.fsmonitor</code></span> is set to <span class="synopsis"><code>.git/hooks/fsmonitor-watchman</code></span> or <span class="synopsis"><code>.git/hooks/fsmonitor-watchmanv2</code></span> depending on the version of the hook to use.</p>   <p>Version 1 takes two arguments, a version (1) and the time in elapsed nanoseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970.</p>   <p>Version 2 takes two arguments, a version (2) and a token that is used for identifying changes since the token. For watchman this would be a clock id. This version must output to stdout the new token followed by a NUL before the list of files.</p>   <p>The hook should output to stdout the list of all files in the working directory that may have changed since the requested time. The logic should be inclusive so that it does not miss any potential changes. The paths should be relative to the root of the working directory and be separated by a single NUL.</p>   <p>It is OK to include files which have not actually changed. All changes including newly-created and deleted files should be included. When files are renamed, both the old and the new name should be included.</p>   <p>Git will limit what files it checks for changes as well as which directories are checked for untracked files based on the path names given.</p>   <p>An optimized way to tell git "all files have changed" is to return the filename <span class="synopsis"><code>/</code></span>.</p>   <p>The exit status determines whether git will use the data from the hook to limit its search. On error, it will fall back to verifying all files and folders.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_p4_changelist">
