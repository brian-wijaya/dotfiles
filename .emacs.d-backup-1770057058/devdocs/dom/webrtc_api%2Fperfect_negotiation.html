<h1>Establishing a connection: The WebRTC perfect negotiation pattern</h1>    <p>This article introduces WebRTC <strong>perfect negotiation</strong>, describing how it works and why it's the recommended way to negotiate a WebRTC connection between peers, and provides sample code to demonstrate the technique.</p> <p>Because <a href="../webrtc_api">WebRTC</a> doesn't mandate a specific transport mechanism for signaling during the negotiation of a new peer connection, it's highly flexible. However, despite that flexibility in transport and communication of signaling messages, there's still a recommended design pattern you should follow when possible, known as perfect negotiation.</p> <p>After the first deployments of WebRTC-capable browsers, it was realized that parts of the negotiation process were more complicated than they needed to be for typical use cases. This was due to a small number of issues with the API and some potential race conditions that needed to be prevented. These issues have since been addressed, letting us simplify our WebRTC negotiation significantly. The perfect negotiation pattern is an example of the ways in which negotiation have improved since the early days of WebRTC.</p>     <mdn-survey></mdn-survey>  <h2 id="perfect_negotiation_concepts" class="heading">Perfect negotiation concepts</h2> <p>Perfect negotiation makes it possible to seamlessly and completely separate the negotiation process from the rest of your application's logic. Negotiation is an inherently asymmetric operation: one side needs to serve as the "caller" while the other peer is the "callee." The perfect negotiation pattern smooths this difference away by separating that difference out into independent negotiation logic, so that your application doesn't need to care which end of the connection it is. As far as your application is concerned, it makes no difference whether you're calling out or receiving a call.</p> <p>The best thing about perfect negotiation is that the same code is used for both the caller and the callee, so there's no repetition or otherwise added levels of negotiation code to write.</p> <p>Perfect negotiation works by assigning each of the two peers a role to play in the negotiation process that's entirely separate from the WebRTC connection state:</p> <ul> <li>A <strong>polite</strong> peer, which uses ICE rollback to prevent collisions with incoming offers. A polite peer, essentially, is one which may send out offers, but then responds if an offer arrives from the other peer with "Okay, never mind, drop my offer and I'll consider yours instead."</li> <li>An <strong>impolite</strong> peer, which always ignores incoming offers that collide with its own offers. It never apologizes or gives up anything to the polite peer. Any time a collision occurs, the impolite peer wins.</li> </ul> <p>This way, both peers know exactly what should happen if there are collisions between offers that have been sent. Responses to error conditions become far more predictable.</p> <p>How you determine which peer is polite and which is impolite is generally up to you. It could be as simple as assigning the polite role to the first peer to connect to the signaling server, or you could do something more elaborate like having the peers exchange random numbers and assigning the polite role to the winner. However you make the determination, once these roles are assigned to the two peers, they can then work together to manage signaling in a way that doesn't deadlock and doesn't require a lot of extra code to manage.</p> <p>An important thing to keep in mind is this: the roles of caller and callee can switch during perfect negotiation. If the polite peer is the caller and it sends an offer but there's a collision with the impolite peer, the polite peer drops its offer and instead replies to the offer it has received from the impolite peer. By doing so, the polite peer has switched from being the caller to the callee!</p> <p>Let's take a look at an example that implements the perfect negotiation pattern. The code assumes that there's a <code>SignalingChannel</code> class defined that is used to communicate with the signaling server. Your own code, of course, can use any signaling technique you like.</p> <p>Note that this code is identical for both peers involved in the connection.</p>  <h2 id="create_the_signaling_and_peer_connections" class="heading">Create the signaling and peer connections</h2> <p>First, the signaling channel needs to be opened and the <a href="../rtcpeerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a> needs to be created. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/STUN">STUN</a> server listed here is obviously not a real one; you'll need to replace <code>stun.my-server.tld</code> with the address of a real STUN server.</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="js">const config = {
  iceServers: [{ urls: "stun:stun.my-stun-server.tld" }],
};

const signaler = new SignalingChannel();
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection(config);
</pre></div> <p>This code also gets the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a> elements using the classes "self-view" and "remote-view"; these will contain, respectively, the local user's self-view and the view of the incoming stream from the remote peer.</p>  <h2 id="connecting_to_a_remote_peer" class="heading">Connecting to a remote peer</h2> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="js">const constraints = { audio: true, video: true };
const selfVideo = document.querySelector("video.self-view");
const remoteVideo = document.querySelector("video.remote-view");

async function start() {
  try {
    const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints);

    for (const track of stream.getTracks()) {
      pc.addTrack(track, stream);
    }
    selfVideo.srcObject = stream;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}
</pre></div> <p>The <code>start()</code> function shown above can be called by either of the two end-points that want to talk to one another. It doesn't matter who does it first; the negotiation will just work.</p> <p>This isn't appreciably different from older WebRTC connection establishment code. The user's camera and microphone are obtained by calling <a href="../mediadevices/getusermedia"><code>getUserMedia()</code></a>. The resulting media tracks are then added to the <a href="../rtcpeerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a> by passing them into <a href="../rtcpeerconnection/addtrack"><code>addTrack()</code></a>. Then, finally, the media source for the self-view <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a> element indicated by the <code>selfVideo</code> constant is set to the camera and microphone stream, allowing the local user to see what the other peer sees.</p>  <h2 id="handling_incoming_tracks" class="heading">Handling incoming tracks</h2> <p>We next need to set up a handler for <a href="../rtcpeerconnection/track_event"><code>track</code></a> events to handle inbound video and audio tracks that have been negotiated to be received by this peer connection. To do this, we implement the <a href="../rtcpeerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a>'s <a href="../rtcpeerconnection/track_event"><code>ontrack</code></a> event handler.</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="js">pc.ontrack = ({ track, streams }) =&gt; {
  track.onunmute = () =&gt; {
    if (remoteVideo.srcObject) {
      return;
    }
    remoteVideo.srcObject = streams[0];
  };
};
</pre></div> <p>When the <code>track</code> event occurs, this handler executes. Using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring">destructuring</a>, the <a href="../rtctrackevent"><code>RTCTrackEvent</code></a>'s <a href="../rtctrackevent/track"><code>track</code></a> and <a href="../rtctrackevent/streams"><code>streams</code></a> properties are extracted. The former is either the video track or the audio track being received. The latter is an array of <a href="../mediastream"><code>MediaStream</code></a> objects, each representing a stream containing this track (a track may in rare cases belong to multiple streams at once). In our case, this will always contain one stream, at index 0, because we passed one stream into <code>addTrack()</code> earlier.</p> <p>We add an unmute event handler to the track, because the track will become unmuted once it starts receiving packets. We put the remainder of our reception code in there.</p> <p>If we already have video coming in from the remote peer (which we can see if the remote view's <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element's <a href="../htmlmediaelement/srcobject"><code>srcObject</code></a> property already has a value), we do nothing. Otherwise, we set <code>srcObject</code> to the stream at index 0 in the <code>streams</code> array.</p>  <h2 id="the_perfect_negotiation_logic" class="heading">The perfect negotiation logic</h2> <p>Now we get into the true perfect negotiation logic, which functions entirely independently from the rest of the application.</p>  <h3 id="handling_the_negotiationneeded_event" class="heading">Handling the negotiationneeded event</h3> <p>First, we implement the <a href="../rtcpeerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a> event handler <a href="../rtcpeerconnection/negotiationneeded_event"><code>onnegotiationneeded</code></a> to get a local description and send it using the signaling channel to the remote peer.</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="js">let makingOffer = false;

pc.onnegotiationneeded = async () =&gt; {
  try {
    makingOffer = true;
    await pc.setLocalDescription();
    signaler.send({ description: pc.localDescription });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } finally {
    makingOffer = false;
  }
};
</pre></div> <p>Note that <code>setLocalDescription()</code> without arguments automatically creates and sets the appropriate description based on the current <a href="../rtcpeerconnection/signalingstate"><code>signalingState</code></a>. The set description is either an answer to the most recent offer from the remote peer <em>or</em> a freshly-created offer if there's no negotiation underway. Here, it will always be an <code>offer</code>, because the negotiationneeded event is only fired in <code>stable</code> state.</p> <p>We set a Boolean variable, <code>makingOffer</code> to <code>true</code> to mark that we're preparing an offer. We set <code>makingOffer</code> immediately before calling <code>setLocalDescription()</code> in order to lock against interfering with sending this offer, and we don't clear it back to <code>false</code> until the offer has been sent to the signaling server (or an error has occurred, preventing the offer from being made). To avoid races, we'll use this value later instead of the signaling state to determine whether or not an offer is being processed because the value of <a href="../rtcpeerconnection/signalingstate"><code>signalingState</code></a> changes asynchronously, introducing a potential collision of an outgoing and an incoming call ("glare").</p>  <h3 id="handling_incoming_ice_candidates" class="heading">Handling incoming ICE candidates</h3> <p>Next, we need to handle the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> event <a href="../rtcpeerconnection/icecandidate_event"><code>icecandidate</code></a>, which is how the local ICE layer passes candidates to us for delivery to the remote peer over the signaling channel.</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="js">pc.onicecandidate = ({ candidate }) =&gt; signaler.send({ candidate });
</pre></div> <p>This takes the <code>candidate</code> member of this ICE event and passes it through to the signaling channel's <code>send()</code> method to be sent over the signaling server to the remote peer.</p>  <h3 id="handling_incoming_messages_on_the_signaling_channel" class="heading">Handling incoming messages on the signaling channel</h3> <p>The last piece of the puzzle is code to handle incoming messages from the signaling server. That's implemented here as an <code>onmessage</code> event handler on the signaling channel object. This method is invoked each time a message arrives from the signaling server.</p> <div class="code-example"><pre data-language="js">let ignoreOffer = false;
let isSettingRemoteAnswerPending = false;

signaler.onmessage = async ({ data: { description, candidate } }) =&gt; {
  try {
    if (description) {
      const readyForOffer =
        !makingOffer &amp;&amp;
        (pc.signalingState === "stable" || isSettingRemoteAnswerPending);
      const offerCollision = description.type === "offer" &amp;&amp; !readyForOffer;

      ignoreOffer = !polite &amp;&amp; offerCollision;
      if (ignoreOffer) {
        return;

</pre></div> <p>Upon receiving an incoming message from the <code>SignalingChannel</code> through its <code>onmessage</code> event handler, the received JSON object is destructured to obtain the <code>description</code> or <code>candidate</code> found within. If the incoming message has a <code>description</code>, it's either an offer or an answer sent by the other peer.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, the message has a <code>candidate</code>, it's an ICE candidate received from the remote peer as part of <a href="../rtcpeerconnection/cantrickleicecandidates">trickle ICE</a>. The candidate is destined to be delivered to the local ICE layer by passing it into <a href="../rtcpeerconnection/addicecandidate"><code>addIceCandidate()</code></a>.</p> <h4 id="on_receiving_a_description">On receiving a description</h4> <p>If we received a <code>description</code>, we prepare to respond to the incoming offer or answer. First, we check to make sure we're in a state in which we can accept an offer. If the connection's signaling state isn't <code>stable</code> or if our end of the connection has started the process of making its own offer, then we need to look out for offer collision.</p> <p>If we're the impolite peer, and we're receiving a colliding offer, we return without setting the description, and instead set <code>ignoreOffer</code> to <code>true</code> to ensure we also ignore all candidates the other side may be sending us on the signaling channel belonging to this offer. Doing so avoids error noise since we never informed our side about this offer.</p> <p>If we're the polite peer, and we're receiving a colliding offer, we don't need to do anything special, because our existing offer will automatically be rolled back in the next step.</p> <p>Having ensured that we want to accept the offer, we set the remote description to the incoming offer by calling <a href="../rtcpeerconnection/setremotedescription"><code>setRemoteDescription()</code></a>. This lets WebRTC know what the proposed configuration of the other peer is. If we're the polite peer, we will drop our offer and accept the new one.</p> <p>If the newly-set remote description is an offer, we ask WebRTC to select an appropriate local configuration by calling the <a href="../rtcpeerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a> method <a href="../rtcpeerconnection/setlocaldescription"><code>setLocalDescription()</code></a> without parameters. This causes <code>setLocalDescription()</code> to automatically generate an appropriate answer in response to the received offer. Then we send the answer through the signaling channel back to the first peer.</p> <h4 id="on_receiving_an_ice_candidate">On receiving an ICE candidate</h4> <p>On the other hand, if the received message contains an ICE candidate, we deliver it to the local <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE">ICE</a> layer by calling the <a href="../rtcpeerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a> method <a href="../rtcpeerconnection/addicecandidate"><code>addIceCandidate()</code></a>. If an error occurs and we've ignored the most recent offer, we also ignore any error that may occur when trying to add the candidate.</p>  <h2 id="see_also" class="heading">See also</h2> <ul> <li><a href="../webrtc_api">WebRTC API</a></li> <li><a href="session_lifetime">Lifetime of a WebRTC session</a></li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
