Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the <a href="#browser_compatibility">compatibility table</a> at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.</p></div> <div class="notecard nonstandard"><p><strong>Non-standard:</strong> This feature is not standardized. We do not recommend using non-standard features in production, as they have limited browser support, and may change or be removed. However, they can be a suitable alternative in specific cases where no standard option exists.</p></div> <p>The read-only <code>region</code> property of the <a href="../paymentaddress"><code>PaymentAddress</code></a> interface returns a string containing the top-level administrative subdivision of the country in which the address is located. For example, this may be a state, province, oblast, or prefecture.</p>     <mdn-survey></mdn-survey>  <h2 id="value" class="heading">Value</h2> <p>A string specifying the top-level administrative subdivision within the country in which the address is located. This region has different names in different countries, such as: state, province, oblast, prefecture, or county.</p>  <h2 id="usage_notes" class="heading">Usage notes</h2> <p>In some countries, like Belgium, it's uncommon for people to provide a region as part of their postal address. In such cases, the browser returns an empty string as the value of <code>region</code>. However, the address should still be acceptable to use for its intended purpose (e.g., to ship a product). However, always verify addresses to make sure what the user provides is usable.</p>  <h2 id="browser_compatibility" class="heading">Browser compatibility</h2> <div class="_table"><table>
