This enables development and operations automation on IBM Z through a seamless, unified workflow orchestration with configuration management, provisioning, and application deployment with Ansible.</p> <section id="ansible-and-z-os-unix-system-services"> <h2>Ansible and z/OS UNIX System Services</h2> <p>UNIX System Services can support the required dependencies for an Ansible managed node including running Python and spawning interactive shell processes through SSH connections. Ansible can target UNIX System Services nodes to modify files, directories, and so on, through <code>ansible.builtin</code> modules. Further, anything that one can do by typing command(s) into the UNIX System Services shell can be captured and automated in an Ansible playbook.</p> </section> <section id="the-z-os-landscape"> <h2>The z/OS landscape</h2> <p>While most systems process files in two modes - binary or text encoded in UTF-8, IBM z/OS including UNIX System Services features an additional third mode - text encoded in EBCDIC. Ansible has provisions to handle binary data and UTF-8 encoded textual data, but not EBCDIC encoded data. This is not necessarily a limitation, it simply requires additional tasks that convert files to and from their original encodings. It is up to the Ansible user managing z/OS UNIX nodes to understand the nature of the files in their automation.</p> <p>The type (binary or text) and encoding of files can be stored in file “tags”. File tags is a z/OS UNIX System Services concept (part of Enhanced ASCII) designed to distinguish binary files from UTF-8 encoded text files and EBCDIC-encoded text files.</p> <p>Default behavior for an un-tagged file or stream is determined by the program, for example, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ibm.com/products/open-enterprise-python-zos">IBM Open Enterprise SDK for Python</a> defaults to the UTF-8 encoding.</p> <p>Ansible modules will not read or recognize file tags. It is up to the user to determine the nature of remote data and tag it appropriately. Data sent to remote z/OS UNIX hosts through Ansible is, by default, encoded in UTF-8 and not tagged. Tagging a file is achievable with an additional task using the <a class="reference internal" href="../collections/ansible/builtin/command_module#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-command-module"><span class="std std-ref">ansible.builtin.command</span></a> module.</p> <pre data-language="yaml">- name: Tag my_file.txt as UTF-8.
  ansible.builtin.command: chtag -tc iso8859-1 my_file.txt
</pre> <p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/latest?topic=shells-introduction-zos">z/OS shell</a> available on z/OS UNIX System Services defaults to an EBCDIC encoding for un-tagged data streams. Ansible sends untagged UTF-8 encoded textual data to the z/OS shell which expects untagged data to be encoded in EBCDIC. This mismatch in data encodings can be resolved by setting the <code>PYTHONSTDINENCODING</code> environment variable, which causes the pipe used by Python to be tagged with the specified encoding. File and pipe tags can be used with automatic conversion between ASCII and EBCDIC, but only programs on z/OS UNIX which are aware of tags will use them.</p> </section> <section id="using-ansible-builtin-modules-with-z-os-unix"> <h2>Using <code>ansible.builtin</code> modules with z/OS UNIX</h2> <p>The <code>ansible.builtin</code> modules operate under the assumption that all textual data (files and pipes/streams) is UTF-8 encoded. On z/OS, since textual data (file or stream) is sometimes encoded in EBCDIC and sometimes in UTF-8, special care must be taken to identify the correct encoding of target data.</p> <p>Here are some notes / pro-tips when using the <code>ansible.builtin</code> modules with z/OS UNIX. This is by no means a comprehensive list. Before using any Ansible modules, you must first <a class="reference internal" href="#configure-zos-remote-environment"><span class="std std-ref">Configure the remote environment</span></a>.</p> <ul> <li>
<dl> <dt>
<a class="reference internal" href="../collections/ansible/builtin/command_module#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-command-module"><span class="std std-ref">ansible.builtin.command</span></a> / <a class="reference internal" href="../collections/ansible/builtin/shell_module#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-shell-module"><span class="std std-ref">ansible.builtin.shell</span></a>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The command and shell modules are excellent for automating tasks for which command line solutions already exist. The thing to keep in mind when using these modules is that depending on the system configuration, the z/OS shell (<code>/bin/sh</code>) may return output in EBCDIC. The LE environment variable configurations will correctly convert streams if they are tagged and return readable output to Ansible. However, some command line programs may return output in UTF-8 and not tag the pipe. In this case, the autoconversion may incorrectly assume output is in EBCDIC and attempt to convert it and yield unreadable data. If the source encoding is known, you can use the <a class="reference internal" href="../collections/ansible/builtin/shell_module#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-shell-module"><span class="std std-ref">ansible.builtin.shell</span></a> module’s capability to chain commands together through pipes, and pipe the output to <code>iconv</code>. In this example, you may need to select other encodings for the ‘to’ and ‘from’ that represent your file encodings.</p> <pre data-language="yaml">ansible.builtin.shell: "some_pgm | iconv -f ibm-1047 -t iso8859-1"

<dd>
<p>The raw module, by design, ignores all remote environment settings. However, z/OS UNIX System Services managed nodes require some base configurations. To use this module with UNIX System Services, configure the minimum environment variables as a chain of export statements before the desired command.</p> <pre data-language="yaml">ansible.builtin.raw: |

<p>The <code>ansible.builtin</code> modules will NOT automatically tag files, nor will existing file tags be honored nor preserved. You can treat files as binaries when running copy/fetch operations, there is no issue in terms of data integrity, but remember to restore the file tag once the file is returned to z/OS UNIX, as tags are not preserved. Use the command module to set the file tag:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">- name: Tag my_file.txt as UTF-8.

<dd>
<p>The built in script module copies a local script file to a temp file on the remote target and runs it. The issue that z/OS UNIX System Services targets run into is that when the underlying z/OS shell attempts to read the script file, since the file does not get tagged as UTF-8 text, the shell assumes that the file is encoded in EBCDIC, and fails to correctly read or run the script. One work-around is to manually copy local files to managed nodes (<a class="reference internal" href="../collections/ansible/builtin/copy_module#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-copy-module"><span class="std std-ref">ansible.builtin.copy</span></a> ) and convert or tag files (with the <a class="reference internal" href="../collections/ansible/builtin/command_module#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-command-module"><span class="std std-ref">ansible.builtin.command</span></a> module). With this work-around, some of the conveniences of the script module are lost, such as automatically cleaning up the script file once it is run, but it is trivial to perform those steps as additional playbook tasks.</p> <pre data-language="yaml">- name: Copy local script file to remote node.
  ansible.builtin.copy:
    src: "{{ playbook_dir }}/local/scripts/sample.sh"
    dest: /u/ibmuser/scripts/

  ansible.builtin.command: "chtag -tc ISO8859-1 /u/ibmuser/scripts/sample.sh"

- name: Run script.
  ansible.builtin.command: "/u/ibmuser/scripts/sample.sh"
</pre> <p>Another work-around is to store local script files in EBCDIC. They may be unreadable on the ansible control node, but they will copy correctly to z/OS UNIX System Services targets in EBCDIC, and the script will run. This approach takes advantage of the built-in conveniences of the script module, but managing unreadable EBCDIC files locally makes maintaining those script files more difficult.</p> </dd> </dl> </li> </ul> </section> <section id="configure-the-remote-environment"> <h2 id="configure-zos-remote-environment">Configure the remote environment</h2> <p>Certain Language Environment (LE) configurations enable automatic encoding conversion and automatic file tagging functionality required by Python on z/OS UNIX systems (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ibm.com/products/open-enterprise-python-zos">IBM Open Enterprise SDK for Python</a> ).</p> <p>Include the following configurations when setting the remote environment for any z/OS UNIX managed nodes:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">_BPXK_AUTOCVT: "ON"
